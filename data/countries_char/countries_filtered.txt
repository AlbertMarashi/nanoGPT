**Australia**, officially the **Commonwealth of Australia**,[^10][^11]
is a [sovereign country](sovereign_state "wikilink") comprising the
[mainland](mainland_Australia "wikilink") of the [Australian
continent](Australia_(continent) "wikilink"), the island of
[Tasmania](Tasmania "wikilink"), and numerous [smaller
islands](list_of_islands_of_Australia "wikilink").`{{Efn|[[Australian Antarctic Territory|41% of the Antarctic continent is also claimed by the country]], however this is only recognised by the UK, France, New Zealand and Norway.}}`{=mediawiki}
Australia is the largest country by area in
[Oceania](Oceania "wikilink") and the world\'s [sixth-largest
country](list_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area "wikilink").
Australia is the oldest,[^12] flattest,[^13] and driest inhabited
continent,[^14][^15] with the least fertile
[soils](soil "wikilink").[^16][^17] It is a [megadiverse
country](megadiverse_countries "wikilink"), and its size gives it a wide
variety of landscapes and climates, with
[deserts](deserts_of_Australia "wikilink") in the centre, [tropical
rainforests](forests_of_Australia "wikilink") in the north-east,
[tropical
savannas](tropical_and_subtropical_grasslands,_savannas,_and_shrublands "wikilink")
in the north, and [mountain
ranges](list_of_mountains_in_Australia "wikilink") in the south-east.

The ancestors of [Aboriginal
Australians](Aboriginal_Australians "wikilink") began arriving from
south-east Asia 50,000 to 65,000 years ago, during the [last glacial
period](Last_Glacial_Period "wikilink").[^18][^19][^20] They settled the
continent and had formed approximately 250 distinct language groups by
the time of European settlement, maintaining some of the longest known
continuing [artistic](Aboriginal_Art "wikilink") and [religious
traditions](The_Dreaming "wikilink") in the world.[^21] Australia\'s
[written history](history_of_Australia "wikilink") commenced with
[European maritime
exploration](European_maritime_exploration_of_Australia "wikilink"). The
Dutch were the first known Europeans to reach Australia, in 1606.
British colonisation began in 1788 with the establishment of the penal
colony of [New South Wales](Colony_of_New_South_Wales "wikilink"). By
the mid-19th century, most of the continent had been explored by
European settlers and five additional self-governing [British
colonies](Crown_colony "wikilink") were established, each gaining
responsible government by 1890. The colonies
[federated](Federation_of_Australia "wikilink") in 1901, forming the
Commonwealth of Australia.[^22] This continued a process of increasing
autonomy from the [United Kingdom](United_Kingdom "wikilink"),
highlighted by the *[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act
1942](Statute_of_Westminster_Adoption_Act_1942 "wikilink")*, and
culminating in the [Australia Acts](Australia_Acts "wikilink") of
1986.[^23]

Australia is a [federal](Federalism_in_Australia "wikilink")
[parliamentary](parliamentary_system "wikilink") [constitutional
monarchy](constitutional_monarchy "wikilink") comprising [six states and
ten territories](States_and_territories_of_Australia "wikilink"). Its
population of nearly {{#expr:`{{Data Australia|poptoday}}`{=mediawiki} /
1000000 round 0}} million[^24] is highly urbanised and heavily
concentrated on the eastern seaboard.[^25]
[Canberra](Canberra "wikilink") is the nation\'s capital, while its most
populous cities are [Sydney](Sydney "wikilink"),
[Melbourne](Melbourne "wikilink"), [Brisbane](Brisbane "wikilink"),
[Perth](Perth "wikilink") and [Adelaide](Adelaide "wikilink").[^26]
Australian governments have promoted
[multiculturalism](Multiculturalism_in_Australia "wikilink") since the
1970s.[^27] Australia is culturally diverse and has one of the highest
foreign-born populations in the world.[^28][^29] Its abundant natural
resources and well-developed international trade relations are crucial
to the country\'s economy, which generates its income from various
sources: predominately services (including
[banking](Banking_in_Australia "wikilink"), [real
estate](Australian_property_market "wikilink") and [international
education](International_students_in_Australia "wikilink")) as well as
[mining](Mining_in_Australia "wikilink"),
[manufacturing](Manufacturing_in_Australia "wikilink") and
[agriculture](Agriculture_in_Australia "wikilink").[^30][^31] It [ranks
highly](International_rankings_of_Australia "wikilink") for quality of
life, health, education, economic freedom, civil liberties and political
rights.[^32]

Australia has a [highly developed](Developed_Countries "wikilink")
market economy and [one of the highest per capita
incomes](List_of_countries_by_GNI_(PPP)_per_capita "wikilink")
globally.[^33][^34][^35] It is a [middle
power](middle_power "wikilink"), and has the world\'s
[thirteenth-highest military
expenditure](List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures "wikilink").[^36][^37]
It is a member of international groups including the [United

## Etymology

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Name of Australia}}
```
The name *Australia* (pronounced
`{{IPAc-en|||s|t|r|e|l|i|}}`{=mediawiki} in [Australian
English](Australian_English "wikilink")[^39]) is derived from the Latin
`{{Lang|la|[[Terra Australis]]}}`{=mediawiki} (\"southern land\"), a
name used for a hypothetical continent in the Southern Hemisphere since
ancient times.[^40] Several sixteenth century cartographers used the
word Australia on maps, but not to identify modern Australia.[^41] When
Europeans began visiting and mapping Australia in the 17th century, the
name `{{Lang|la|Terra Australis}}`{=mediawiki} was applied to the new
territories.`{{Refn|The earliest recorded use of the word ''Australia'' in English was in 1625 in "A note of Australia del Espritu Santo, written by Sir [[Richard Hakluyt]]", published by [[Samuel Purchas]] in ''Hakluytus Posthumus'', a corruption of the original Spanish name "Austrialia del Espritu Santo" (Southern Land of the Holy Spirit)<ref>[http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/discover_collections/history_nation/queiros/index.html "He named it Austrialia del Espiritu Santo and claimed it for Spain"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817051612/http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/discover_collections/history_nation/queiros/index.html |date=17 August 2013}} ''The Spanish quest for Terra Australis|State Library of New South Wales Page 1''</ref><ref>[http://rupertgerritsen.tripod.com/pdf/published/Austrialia_Globe_72_2013_pp23-30.pdf "A note on 'Austrialia' or 'Australia' Rupert Gerritsen  Journal of The Australian and New Zealand Map Society Inc.

Until the early 19th century, Australia was best known as *[New
Holland](New_Holland_(Australia) "wikilink")*, a name first applied by
the Dutch explorer [Abel Tasman](Abel_Tasman "wikilink") in 1644 (as
`{{Lang|nl|Nieuw-Holland}}`{=mediawiki}) and subsequently anglicised.
`{{Lang|la|Terra Australis}}`{=mediawiki} still saw occasional usage,
such as in scientific
texts.`{{Refn|For instance, the 1814 work ''[[A Voyage to Terra Australis]]''|group="N"}}`{=mediawiki}
The name *Australia* was popularised by the explorer [Matthew
Flinders](Matthew_Flinders "wikilink"), who said it was \"more agreeable
to the ear, and an assimilation to the names of the other great portions
of the Earth\".[^42] The first time that *Australia* appears to have
been officially used was in April 1817, when Governor [Lachlan
Macquarie](Lachlan_Macquarie "wikilink") acknowledged the receipt of
Flinders\' charts of Australia from [Lord
Bathurst](Henry_Bathurst,_3rd_Earl_Bathurst "wikilink").[^43] In
December 1817, Macquarie recommended to the [Colonial
Office](Colonial_Office "wikilink") that it be formally adopted.[^44] In
1824, the [Admiralty](British_Admiralty "wikilink") agreed that the
continent should be known officially by that name.[^45] The first
official published use of the new name came with the publication in 1830
of *The Australia Directory* by the [Hydrographic
Office](United_Kingdom_Hydrographic_Office "wikilink").[^46]

Colloquial names for Australia include
\"[Oz](Name_of_Australia#Oz "wikilink")\", \"Straya\" and \"[Down
Under](Down_Under "wikilink")\".[^47] Other epithets include \"the Great
Southern Land\", \"[the Lucky Country](the_Lucky_Country "wikilink")\",
\"the Sunburnt Country\", and \"the Wide Brown Land\". The latter two
both derive from [Dorothea Mackellar](Dorothea_Mackellar "wikilink")\'s
1908 poem \"[My Country](My_Country "wikilink")\".[^48]

{{Main|Prehistory of Australia|Indigenous Australians}}
```
[thumb\|upright=1.0\|right\|[Aboriginal rock
art](Aboriginal_rock_art "wikilink") in the
[Kimberley](Kimberley_(Western_Australia) "wikilink") region of Western
Australia](File:Bradshaw_rock_paintings.jpg "wikilink")

[Indigenous Australians](Indigenous_Australians "wikilink") comprise two
broad groups: the [Aboriginal
peoples](Aboriginal_Australians "wikilink") of the Australian mainland
(and surrounding islands including Tasmania), and the [Torres Strait
Islanders](Torres_Strait_Islanders "wikilink"), who are a distinct
[Melanesian](Melanesia "wikilink") people. Human habitation of the
Australian continent is estimated to have begun 50,000 to 65,000 years
ago,[^49][^50][^51][^52] with the migration of people by [land
bridges](land_bridge "wikilink") and short sea crossings from what is
now Southeast Asia.[^53] It is uncertain how many waves of immigration
may have contributed to these ancestors of modern Aboriginal
Australians.[^54][^55] The [Madjedbebe](Madjedbebe "wikilink") rock
shelter in [Arnhem Land](Arnhem_Land "wikilink") is recognised as the
oldest site showing the presence of humans in Australia.[^56] The oldest
human remains found are the [Lake Mungo
remains](Lake_Mungo_remains "wikilink"), which have been dated to around
41,000 years ago.[^57][^58]

Aboriginal Australian culture is one of the oldest continuous cultures
on Earth.[^59][^60][^61][^62] At the time of first European contact,
Aboriginal Australians were complex
[hunter-gatherers](hunter-gatherer "wikilink") with diverse economies
and societies, and spread across at least [250 different language
groups](Australian_Aboriginal_languages "wikilink").[^63][^64] Estimates
of the Aboriginal population before British settlement range from
300,000 to one million.[^65][^66] Aboriginal Australians have an oral
culture with [spiritual
values](Australian_Aboriginal_religion_and_mythology "wikilink") based
on reverence for the land and a belief in the
[Dreamtime](Dreamtime "wikilink").[^67] Certain groups engaged in
[fire-stick farming](fire-stick_farming "wikilink"),[^68][^69] [fish
farming](fish_farming "wikilink"),[^70][^71] and built [semi-permanent
shelters](Indigenous_architecture#Australia "wikilink").[^72][^73] The
extent to which some groups engaged in agriculture is
controversial.[^74][^75][^76]

The Torres Strait Islander people first settled their islands around
4,000 years ago.[^77] Culturally and linguistically distinct from
mainland Aboriginal peoples, they were seafarers and obtained their
livelihood from seasonal horticulture and the resources of their reefs
and seas.[^78] Agriculture also developed on some islands and villages
appeared by the 1300s.[^79]

By the mid-18th century in northern Australia, [contact, trade and
cross-cultural engagement](Makassan_contact_with_Australia "wikilink")
had been established between local Aboriginal groups and
[Makassan](Makassar_people "wikilink")
[trepangers](trepanging "wikilink"), visiting from present-day
Indonesia.[^80][^81][^82]

Bay](Botany_Bay "wikilink") on 29 April 1770 to claim Australia\'s east
coast for [Great
Britain](Kingdom_of_Great_Britain "wikilink")](Landing_of_Lieutenant_James_Cook_at_Botany_Bay,_29_April_1770_(painting_by_E_Phillips_Fox).jpg "Landing of James Cook at Botany Bay on 29 April 1770 to claim Australia's east coast for Great Britain")
The Dutch are the first Europeans that recorded sighting and making
landfall on the Australian mainland.[^83] The first ship and crew to
chart the Australian coast and meet with Aboriginal people was the
*[Duyfken](Duyfken "wikilink")*, captained by Dutch navigator [Willem
Janszoon](Willem_Janszoon "wikilink").[^84] He sighted the coast of
[Cape York Peninsula](Cape_York_Peninsula "wikilink") in early 1606, and
made landfall on 26 February 1606 at the [Pennefather
River](Pennefather_River "wikilink") near the modern town of
[Weipa](Weipa,_Queensland "wikilink") on Cape York.[^85] Later that
year, Spanish explorer [Lus Vaz de
Torres](Lus_Vaz_de_Torres "wikilink") sailed through and navigated the
[Torres Strait Islands](Torres_Strait_Islands "wikilink").[^86] The
Dutch charted the whole of the western and northern coastlines and named
the island continent \"[New
Holland](New_Holland_(Australia) "wikilink")\" during the 17th century,
and although no attempt at settlement was made,[^87] [a number of
shipwrecks](Shipwrecks_of_Western_Australia#Notable_wrecks "wikilink")
left men either stranded or, as in the case of the
*[Batavia](Batavia_(1628_ship) "wikilink")* in 1629, marooned for mutiny
and murder, thus becoming the first Europeans to permanently inhabit the
continent.[^88] In 1770, Captain [James Cook](James_Cook "wikilink")
sailed along and mapped the east coast, which he named \"[New South
Wales](New_South_Wales "wikilink")\" and claimed for Great Britain.[^89]

Following the loss of its [American
colonies](Thirteen_Colonies "wikilink") in 1783, the British Government
sent a fleet of ships, the [First Fleet](First_Fleet "wikilink"), under
the command of Captain [Arthur Phillip](Arthur_Phillip "wikilink"), to
establish a new [penal colony](penal_colony "wikilink") in New South
Wales. A camp was set up and the [Union Flag](Union_Flag "wikilink")
raised at [Sydney Cove](Sydney_Cove "wikilink"), [Port
Jackson](Port_Jackson "wikilink"), on 26 January 1788,[^90][^91] a date
which later became [Australia\'s national
day](Australia_Day "wikilink").

Most early settlers were [convicts](convicts_in_Australia "wikilink"),
[transported](penal_transportation "wikilink") for petty crimes and
[assigned](convict_assignment "wikilink") as labourers or servants to
\"free settlers\" (willing immigrants). Once
[emancipated](emancipist "wikilink"), convicts tended to integrate into
colonial society. Martial law was declared to suppress convict
rebellions and uprisings,[^92] and lasted for two years following the
1808 [Rum Rebellion](Rum_Rebellion "wikilink"), the only successful
armed takeover of government in Australia.[^93] Over the next two
decades, social and economic reforms, together with the establishment of
a [Legislative Council](New_South_Wales_Legislative_Council "wikilink")
and [Supreme Court](Supreme_Court_of_New_South_Wales "wikilink"), saw
New South Wales transition from a penal colony to a civil
society.[^94][^95][^96]`{{Page needed|date=February 2024}}`{=mediawiki}

The indigenous population declined for 150 years following European
settlement, mainly due to infectious disease.[^97][^98] British colonial
authorities did not sign any treaties with [Aboriginal
groups](Aboriginal_Australians#Groups_and_sub-groups "wikilink").[^99][^100]
As settlement expanded, thousands of Indigenous people died in [frontier
conflicts](Australian_frontier_wars "wikilink") while others were
dispossessed of their traditional lands.[^101]

[thumb\|upright=1.0\|right\|alt=A calm body of water is in the
foreground. The shoreline is about 200 metres away. To the left, close
to the shore, are three tall [gum trees](Eucalyptus "wikilink"); behind
them on an incline are ruins, including walls and watchtowers of
light-coloured stone and brick, what appear to be the foundations of
walls, and grassed areas. To the right lie the outer walls of a large
rectangular four-storey building dotted with regularly spaced windows.
Forested land rises gently to a peak several kilometres back from the
shore.\|Tasmania\'s [Port Arthur](Port_Arthur,_Tasmania "wikilink")
penal settlement is one of eleven UNESCO World Heritage-listed
[Australian Convict
Sites](Australian_Convict_Sites "wikilink").](File:PortArthurPenitentiary.jpg "wikilink")

In 1803, a settlement was established in [Van Diemen\'s
Land](Van_Diemen's_Land "wikilink") (present-day
[Tasmania](Tasmania "wikilink")),[^102] and in 1813, [Gregory
Blaxland](Gregory_Blaxland "wikilink"), [William
Lawson](William_Lawson_(explorer) "wikilink") and [William
Wentworth](William_Wentworth "wikilink")
[crossed](1813_crossing_of_the_Blue_Mountains "wikilink") the [Blue
Mountains](Blue_Mountains_(New_South_Wales) "wikilink") west of Sydney,
opening the interior to European settlement.[^103] The British claim
extended to the whole Australian continent in 1827 when Major [Edmund
Lockyer](Edmund_Lockyer "wikilink") established a settlement on [King
George Sound](King_George_Sound "wikilink") (modern-day
[Albany](Albany,_Western_Australia "wikilink")).[^104] The [Swan River
Colony](Swan_River_Colony "wikilink") (present-day
[Perth](Perth "wikilink")) was established in 1829, evolving into the
largest Australian colony by area, [Western
Australia](Western_Australia "wikilink").[^105] In accordance with
population growth, separate colonies were carved from New South Wales:
Tasmania in 1825, [South Australia](South_Australia "wikilink") in 1836,
[New Zealand](New_Zealand "wikilink") in 1841,
[Victoria](Victoria_(Australia) "wikilink") in 1851, and
[Queensland](Queensland "wikilink") in 1859.[^106] South Australia was
founded as a free colony---it never accepted transported convicts.[^107]
Growing [opposition to the convict
system](Australasian_Anti-Transportation_League "wikilink") culminated
in its abolition in the eastern colonies by the 1850s. Initially a free
colony, Western Australia practised penal transportation from 1850 to
1868.[^108]

The six colonies individually gained [responsible
government](responsible_government "wikilink") between 1855 and 1890,
thus becoming elective democracies managing most of their own affairs
while remaining part of the [British
Empire](British_Empire "wikilink").[^109] The Colonial Office in London
retained control of some matters, notably foreign affairs.[^110]

In the mid-19th century, explorers such as [Burke and
Wills](Burke_and_Wills_expedition "wikilink") charted Australia\'s
interior.[^111] A [series of gold
rushes](Australian_gold_rushes "wikilink") beginning in the early 1850s
led to an influx of new migrants from
[China](Chinese_Australians "wikilink"), North America and continental
Europe,[^112] as well as outbreaks of
[bushranging](bushranger "wikilink") and civil unrest; the latter peaked
in 1854 when [Ballarat](Ballarat "wikilink") miners launched the [Eureka
Rebellion](Eureka_Rebellion "wikilink") against gold license fees.[^113]
The 1860s saw a surge in [blackbirding](blackbirding "wikilink"), where
[Pacific Islanders](Pacific_Islander "wikilink") were forced into
indentured labour, mainly in Queensland.[^114][^115]

From 1886, Australian colonial governments began introducing policies
resulting in the [removal of many Aboriginal
children](Stolen_Generations "wikilink") from their families and
communities.[^116] The [Second Boer War](Second_Boer_War "wikilink")
(1899--1902) marked the largest overseas deployment of [Australia\'s
colonial forces](colonial_forces_of_Australia "wikilink").[^117][^118]

first Australian Parliament in
1901.](Opening_of_the_first_parliament.jpg "The Big Picture, a painting by Tom Roberts, depicts the opening of the first Australian Parliament in 1901.")
On 1 January 1901, [federation of the
colonies](Federation_of_Australia "wikilink") was achieved after a
decade of planning, [constitutional
conventions](Constitutional_Convention_(Australia) "wikilink") and
[referendums](18981900_Australian_constitutional_referendums "wikilink"),
resulting in the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia as a
nation under the new [Australian
Constitution](Constitution_of_Australia "wikilink").[^119]

After the [1907 Imperial
Conference](1907_Imperial_Conference "wikilink"), Australia and several
other self-governing British [settler
colonies](settler_colonialism "wikilink") were given the status of
self-governing [dominions](dominion "wikilink") within the British
Empire.[^120] Australia was one of the founding members of the [League
of Nations](League_of_Nations "wikilink") in 1920,[^121] and
subsequently of the [United
Nations](Member_states_of_the_United_Nations "wikilink") in 1945.[^122]
The [Statute of Westminster
1931](Statute_of_Westminster_1931 "wikilink") formally ended the ability
of the UK to pass laws with effect at the Commonwealth level in
Australia without the country\'s consent. Australia [adopted
it](Statute_of_Westminster_Adoption_Act_1942 "wikilink") in 1942, but it
was backdated to 1939 to confirm the validity of legislation passed by
the Australian Parliament during World War II.[^123][^124][^125]

The [Australian Capital
Territory](Australian_Capital_Territory "wikilink") was formed in 1911
as the location for the future federal capital of
[Canberra](Canberra "wikilink").[^126] While it was being constructed,
[Melbourne](Melbourne "wikilink") served as the temporary capital from
1901 to 1927.[^127] The [Northern
Territory](Northern_Territory "wikilink") was transferred from the
control of the South Australian government to the federal parliament in
1911.[^128] Australia became the colonial ruler of the [Territory of
Papua](Territory_of_Papua "wikilink") (which had initially been annexed
by Queensland in 1883) in 1902 and of the [Territory of New
Guinea](Territory_of_New_Guinea "wikilink") (formerly [German New
Guinea](German_New_Guinea "wikilink")) in 1920.[^129][^130] The two were
unified as the [Territory of Papua and New
Guinea](Territory_of_Papua_and_New_Guinea "wikilink") in 1949 and gained
independence from Australia in 1975.[^131][^132]

![The 1942 [Bombing of Darwin](Bombing_of_Darwin "wikilink"), the first
of over 100 [Japanese air raids on
Australia](Air_raids_on_Australia,_19421943 "wikilink") during [World
War
II](World_War_II "wikilink")](Darwin_42.jpg "The 1942 Bombing of Darwin, the first of over 100 Japanese air raids on Australia during World War II")
In 1914, Australia joined the [Allies](Allies_of_World_War_I "wikilink")
in fighting the First World War, and took part in many of the major
battles fought on the [Western
Front](Western_Front_(World_War_I) "wikilink").[^133] Of about 416,000
who served, about 60,000 were killed and another 152,000 were
wounded.[^134] Many Australians regard the defeat of the [Australian and
New Zealand Army
Corps](Australian_and_New_Zealand_Army_Corps "wikilink") (ANZAC) at
[Gallipoli](Gallipoli_Campaign "wikilink") in 1915 as the \"baptism of
fire\" that forged the [new nation\'s
identity](Anzac_spirit "wikilink").[^135][^136][^137] The [beginning of
the campaign](Landing_at_Anzac_Cove "wikilink") is commemorated annually
on [Anzac day](Anzac_Day "wikilink"), a date which rivals Australia day
as the nation\'s most important.[^138][^139]

From 1939 to 1945, Australia joined the
[Allies](Allies_of_World_War_II "wikilink") in fighting the Second World
War. Australia\'s [armed forces](Australian_Defence_Force "wikilink")
fought in the [Pacific](Pacific_War "wikilink"),
[European](European_Theatre_of_World_War_II "wikilink") and
[Mediterranean and Middle
East](Mediterranean_and_Middle_East_theatre_of_World_War_II "wikilink")

The shock of Britain\'s [defeat in
Singapore](fall_of_Singapore "wikilink") in 1942, followed soon after by
the [bombing of Darwin](bombing_of_Darwin "wikilink") and [other
Japanese attacks on Australian
soil](Air_raids_on_Australia,_194243 "wikilink"), led to a widespread
belief in Australia that [a Japanese invasion was
imminent](Proposed_Japanese_invasion_of_Australia_during_World_War_II "wikilink"),
and a shift from the United Kingdom to the [United
States](AustraliaUnited_States_relations "wikilink") as Australia\'s
principal ally and security partner.[^142] Since 1951, Australia has
been allied with the United States under the [ANZUS](ANZUS "wikilink")
treaty.[^143]

### Post-war and contemporary eras {#post_war_and_contemporary_eras}

Europe arriving in Australia in
1954](Dutch_Migrant_1954_MariaScholte=50000thToAustraliaPostWW2.jpg "Postwar migrants from Europe arriving in Australia in 1954")
In the decades following World War II, Australia enjoyed significant
increases in living standards, leisure time and suburban
development.[^144][^145] Using the slogan \"populate or perish\", the
nation encouraged a [large wave of immigration from across
Europe](Post-war_immigration_to_Australia "wikilink"), with such
immigrants referred to as \"[New
Australians](New_Australians "wikilink")\".[^146]

A member of the [Western Bloc](Western_Bloc "wikilink") during the [Cold
War](Cold_War "wikilink"), Australia participated in the [Korean
War](Australia_in_the_Korean_War "wikilink") and the [Malayan
Emergency](Military_history_of_Australia_during_the_Malayan_Emergency "wikilink")
during the 1950s and the [Vietnam
War](Military_history_of_Australia_during_the_Vietnam_War "wikilink")
from 1962 to 1972.[^147] During this time, tensions over communist
influence in society led to [unsuccessful
attempts](1951_Australian_Communist_Party_ban_referendum "wikilink") by
the [Menzies Government](Menzies_Government_(19491966) "wikilink") to
ban the [Communist Party of
Australia](Communist_Party_of_Australia "wikilink"),[^148] and a [bitter
split](Australian_Labor_Party_split_of_1955 "wikilink") in the [Labor
Party](Australian_Labor_Party "wikilink") in 1955.[^149]

As a result of a [1967
referendum](Australian_referendum,_1967_(Aboriginals) "wikilink"), the
federal government gained the power to legislate with regard to
Indigenous Australians, and Indigenous Australians were fully included
in the [census](Census_in_Australia "wikilink").[^150] [Pre-colonial
land interests](Aboriginal_title "wikilink") (referred to as [native
title](Native_title_in_Australia "wikilink") in Australia) was
recognised in law for the first time when the [High Court of
Australia](High_Court_of_Australia "wikilink") held in *[Mabo v
Queensland (No 2)](Mabo_v_Queensland_(No_2) "wikilink")* that Australia
was neither *[terra nullius](terra_nullius "wikilink")* (\"land
belonging to no one\") or \"desert and uncultivated land\" at the time
of European settlement.[^151][^152]

Following the abolition of the last vestiges of the [White Australia
policy](White_Australia_policy "wikilink") in 1973,[^153] Australia\'s
demography and culture transformed as a result of a large and ongoing
wave of non-European immigration, mostly from Asia.[^154][^155] The late
20th century also saw an increasing focus on foreign policy ties with
other [Pacific Rim](Pacific_Rim "wikilink") nations.[^156] The
[Australia Acts](Australia_Acts "wikilink") severed the remaining
constitutional ties between Australia and the United Kingdom while
maintaining the monarch in her independent capacity as [Queen of
Australia](Queen_of_Australia "wikilink").[^157][^158] In a [1999
constitutional
referendum](1999_Australian_republic_referendum "wikilink"), 55% of
voters rejected [abolishing the
monarchy](Republicanism_in_Australia "wikilink") and becoming a
republic.[^159]

Following the [September 11 attacks](September_11_attacks "wikilink") on
the United States, Australia joined the United States in fighting the
[Afghanistan
War](Military_history_of_Australia_during_the_War_in_Afghanistan "wikilink")
from 2001 to 2021 and the [Iraq
War](Australian_contribution_to_the_2003_invasion_of_Iraq "wikilink")
from 2003 to 2009.[^160] The nation\'s trade relations also became
increasingly oriented towards East Asia in the 21st century, with China
becoming the nation\'s [largest trading
partner](List_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_Australia "wikilink")
by a large margin.[^161]

In 2020, during the [COVID-19
pandemic](COVID-19_pandemic_in_Australia "wikilink"), several of
Australia\'s largest cities were [locked
down](COVID-19_lockdowns "wikilink") for extended periods and free
movement across the national and state borders was restricted in an
attempt to slow the spread of the [SARS-CoV-2
virus](Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2 "wikilink").[^162]

Surrounded by the Indian and Pacific
oceans,`{{Refn|Australia describes the body of water south of its mainland as the [[Southern Ocean]], rather than the Indian Ocean as defined by the [[International Hydrographic Organization]] (IHO). In 2000, a vote of IHO member nations defined the term "Southern Ocean" as applying only to the waters between [[Antarctica]] and [[60th parallel south|60 south]] latitude.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://geography.about.com/od/learnabouttheearth/a/fifthocean.htm|last=Rosenberg|first=Matt |title=The New Fifth Ocean  The World's Newest Ocean  The Southern Ocean|publisher=About.com: Geography|date=20 August 2009 |access-date=5 April 2010 |archive-date=26 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126025233/http://geography.about.com/od/learnabouttheearth/a/fifthocean.htm |url-status=dead}}</ref>|name="Southern Ocean"|group="N"}}`{=mediawiki}
Australia is separated from Asia by the
[Arafura](Arafura_Sea "wikilink") and [Timor](Timor_Sea "wikilink")
seas, with the [Coral Sea](Coral_Sea "wikilink") lying off the
Queensland coast, and the [Tasman Sea](Tasman_Sea "wikilink") lying
between Australia and New Zealand. The world\'s smallest continent[^163]
and [sixth largest country by total
area](List_of_countries_and_outlying_territories_by_total_area "wikilink"),[^164]
Australia---owing to its size and isolation---is often dubbed the
\"island continent\"[^165] and is sometimes considered the [world\'s
largest island](List_of_islands_by_area "wikilink").[^166] Australia has
`{{Cvt|34218|km}}`{=mediawiki} of coastline (excluding all offshore
islands),[^167] and claims an extensive [Exclusive Economic
Zone](Exclusive_economic_zone "wikilink") of
`{{Convert|8148250|km2|sqmi}}`{=mediawiki}. This exclusive economic zone
does not include the [Australian Antarctic
Territory](Australian_Antarctic_Territory "wikilink").[^168]

Mainland Australia lies between latitudes
[9](9th_parallel_south "wikilink") and [44
South](44th_parallel_south "wikilink"), and longitudes
[112](112th_meridian_east "wikilink") and [154
East](154th_meridian_east "wikilink").[^169] Australia\'s size gives it
a wide variety of landscapes, with tropical rainforests in the
north-east, mountain ranges in the south-east, south-west and east, and
desert in the centre.[^170] The desert or semi-arid land commonly known
as the [outback](outback "wikilink") makes up by far the largest portion
of land.[^171] Australia is the driest inhabited continent; its annual
rainfall averaged over continental area is less than 500 mm.[^172] The
[population
density](List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population_density "wikilink")
is 3.4 inhabitants per square kilometre, although the large majority of
the population lives along the temperate south-eastern coastline. The
population density exceeds 19,500 inhabitants per square kilometre in
central Melbourne.[^173] In 2021 Australia had 10% of the global
permanent meadows and pastureland.[^174]

Eastern Australia is marked by the [Great Dividing
Range](Great_Dividing_Range "wikilink"), which runs parallel to the
coast of Queensland, New South Wales and much of Victoria. The name is
not strictly accurate, because parts of the range consist of low hills,
and the highlands are typically no more than
`{{Cvt|1600|m}}`{=mediawiki} in height.[^178] The [coastal
uplands](Eastern_Australian_temperate_forests "wikilink") and a [belt of
Brigalow grasslands](Brigalow_Belt "wikilink") lie between the coast and
the mountains, while inland of the dividing range are large areas of
grassland and shrubland.[^179][^180] These include the [western
plains](Southeast_Australia_temperate_savanna "wikilink") of New South
Wales, and the [Mitchell Grass Downs](Mitchell_Grass_Downs "wikilink")

### Geology

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Geology of Australia}}
```
[thumb\|upright=1.2\|right\|Basic geological regions of Australia, by
age](File:Ausgeolbasic.jpg "wikilink")

Lying on the [Indo-Australian Plate](Indo-Australian_Plate "wikilink"),
the mainland of Australia is the lowest and most primordial landmass on
Earth with a relatively stable geological history.[^198][^199] The
landmass includes virtually all known rock types and from all geological
time periods spanning over 3.8 billion years of the Earth\'s history.
The [Pilbara Craton](Pilbara_Craton "wikilink") is one of only two
pristine [Archaean](Archean "wikilink") 3.6--2.7 Ga (billion years ago)
crusts identified on the Earth.[^200]

Having been part of all major
[supercontinents](supercontinent "wikilink"), the [Australian
continent](Australia_(continent) "wikilink") began to form after the
breakup of [Gondwana](Gondwana "wikilink") in the
[Permian](Permian "wikilink"), with the separation of the continental
landmass from the African continent and Indian subcontinent. It
separated from Antarctica over a prolonged period beginning in the
[Permian](Permian "wikilink") and continuing through to the
[Cretaceous](Cretaceous "wikilink").[^201] When the [last glacial
period](last_glacial_period "wikilink") ended in about 10,000 BC, rising
sea levels formed [Bass Strait](Bass_Strait "wikilink"), separating
[Tasmania](Tasmania "wikilink") from the mainland. Then between about
8,000 and 6,500 BC, the lowlands in the north were flooded by the sea,
separating New Guinea, the [Aru Islands](Aru_Islands "wikilink"), and
the mainland of Australia.[^202] The Australian continent is moving
toward [Eurasia](Eurasia "wikilink") at the rate of 6 to 7 centimetres a
year.[^203]

The Australian mainland\'s [continental
crust](continental_crust "wikilink"), excluding the thinned margins, has
an average thickness of 38`{{Nbsp}}`{=mediawiki}km, with a range in
thickness from 24 km to 59 km.[^204] Australia\'s geology can be divided
into several main sections, showcasing that the continent grew from west
to east: the Archaean [cratonic](craton "wikilink") shields found mostly
in the west, [Proterozoic](Proterozoic "wikilink") [fold
belts](orogeny "wikilink") in the centre and
[Phanerozoic](Phanerozoic "wikilink") [sedimentary
basins](sedimentary_basins "wikilink"), metamorphic and [igneous
rocks](igneous_rocks "wikilink") in the east.[^205]

The Australian mainland and Tasmania are situated in the middle of the
[tectonic plate](tectonic_plate "wikilink") and have no active
volcanoes,[^206] but due to passing over the [East Australia
hotspot](East_Australia_hotspot "wikilink"), recent volcanism has
occurred during the [Holocene](Holocene "wikilink"), in the [Newer
Volcanics Province](Newer_Volcanics_Province "wikilink") of western
Victoria and south-eastern South Australia. Volcanism also occurs in the
island of New Guinea (considered geologically as part of the Australian
continent), and in the Australian external territory of [Heard Island
and McDonald
Islands](Heard_Island_and_McDonald_Islands "wikilink").[^207] [Seismic
activity](List_of_earthquakes_in_Australia "wikilink") in the Australian
mainland and Tasmania is also low, with the greatest number of
fatalities having occurred in the [1989 Newcastle
earthquake](1989_Newcastle_earthquake "wikilink").[^208]

### Climate

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Climate of Australia}}
```
[thumb\|upright=1.2\|right\|[Kppen climate
types](Kppen_climate_classification "wikilink") of
Australia[^209]](File:Australia_Kppen.svg "wikilink")

The climate of Australia is significantly influenced by ocean currents,
including the [Indian Ocean Dipole](Indian_Ocean_Dipole "wikilink") and
the [El Nio--Southern
Oscillation](El_NioSouthern_Oscillation "wikilink"), which is
correlated with periodic [drought](Drought_in_Australia "wikilink"), and
the seasonal tropical low-pressure system that produces cyclones in
northern Australia.[^210][^211] These factors cause rainfall to vary
markedly from year to year. Much of the northern part of the country has
a tropical, predominantly summer-rainfall
([monsoon](monsoon "wikilink")).[^212] The south-west corner of the
country has a [Mediterranean
climate](Mediterranean_climate "wikilink").[^213] The south-east ranges
from [oceanic](oceanic_climate "wikilink") (Tasmania and coastal
Victoria) to [humid subtropical](humid_subtropical "wikilink") (upper
half of New South Wales), with the highlands featuring
[alpine](alpine_climate "wikilink") and [subpolar oceanic
climates](subpolar_oceanic_climate "wikilink"). The interior is
[arid](arid "wikilink") to [semi-arid](semi-arid "wikilink").[^214]

Driven by climate change, average temperatures have risen [more than 1C
since 1960](Climate_change_in_Australia "wikilink"). Associated changes
in rainfall patterns and climate extremes exacerbate existing issues
such as drought and [bushfires](Bushfires_in_Australia "wikilink"). 2019
was Australia\'s warmest recorded year,[^215] and the [2019--2020
bushfire season](201920_Australian_bushfire_season "wikilink") was the
country\'s worst [on
record](List_of_Australian_bushfire_seasons "wikilink").[^216]
[Australia\'s greenhouse gas
emissions](Greenhouse_gas_emissions_by_Australia "wikilink") per capita
are among the highest in the world.[^217]

[Water restrictions](Water_restrictions_in_Australia "wikilink") are
frequently in place in many regions and cities of Australia in response
to chronic shortages due to urban population increases and localised
drought.[^218][^219] Throughout much of the continent, [major
flooding](Floods_in_Australia "wikilink") regularly follows extended
periods of drought, flushing out inland river systems, overflowing dams
and inundating large inland flood plains, as occurred throughout Eastern
Australia in the early 2010s after the [2000s Australian
drought](2000s_Australian_drought "wikilink").[^220]

### Biodiversity

[thumb\|upright=1.0\|left\|alt=A koala holding onto a eucalyptus tree

[koala](koala "wikilink") and the *[eucalyptus](eucalyptus "wikilink")*

pair.](File:Koala_climbing_tree.jpg "wikilink")

Although most of Australia is semi-arid or desert, the continent
includes a diverse range of habitats from
[alpine](alpine_climate "wikilink") heaths to [tropical
rainforests](tropical_rainforest "wikilink"). Fungi typify that
diversity---an estimated 250,000 species---of which only 5% have been
described---occur in Australia.[^221] Because of the continent\'s great
age, extremely variable weather patterns, and long-term geographic
isolation, much of Australia\'s [biota](biota_(ecology) "wikilink") is
unique. About 85% of flowering plants, 84% of mammals, more than 45% of
[birds](List_of_birds_of_Australia "wikilink"), and 89% of in-shore,
temperate-zone fish are [endemic](endemism "wikilink").[^222] Australia
has at least 755 species of reptile, more than any other country in the
world.[^223] Besides Antarctica, Australia is the only continent that
developed without feline species. Feral cats may have been introduced in
the 17th century by Dutch shipwrecks, and later in the 18th century by
European settlers. They are now considered a major factor in the decline
and extinction of many vulnerable and endangered native species.[^224]
Seafaring immigrants from Asia are believed to have brought the
[dingo](dingo "wikilink") to Australia sometime after the end of the
last ice age`{{Mdash}}`{=mediawiki}perhaps 4000 years
ago`{{Mdash}}`{=mediawiki}and Aboriginal people helped disperse them
across the continent as pets, contributing to the demise of
[thylacines](thylacines "wikilink") on the
mainland.[^225]`{{Page needed|date=February 2024}}`{=mediawiki}
Australia is also one of 17 megadiverse countries.[^226]

[Australian forests](Forests_of_Australia "wikilink") are mostly made up
of evergreen species, particularly [eucalyptus](eucalyptus "wikilink")
trees in the less arid regions; [wattles](Acacia "wikilink") replace
them as the dominant species in drier regions and deserts.[^227] Among
well-known [Australian animals](fauna_of_Australia "wikilink") are the
[monotremes](monotreme "wikilink") (the [platypus](platypus "wikilink")
and [echidna](echidna "wikilink")); a host of
[marsupials](marsupial "wikilink"), including the
[kangaroo](kangaroo "wikilink"), koala, and wombat, and birds such as
the emu and the kookaburra.[^228] Australia is home to [many dangerous
animals](Animal_attacks_in_Australia "wikilink") including some of the
most venomous snakes in the world.[^229] The [dingo](dingo "wikilink")
was introduced by Austronesian people who traded with Indigenous
Australians around 3000 [BCE](Common_Era "wikilink").[^230] Many animal
and plant species became extinct soon after first human
settlement,[^231] including the [Australian
megafauna](Australian_megafauna "wikilink"); others have disappeared
since European settlement, among them the thylacine.[^232][^233]

Many of Australia\'s ecoregions, and the species within those regions,
are threatened by human activities and
[introduced](Invasive_species_in_Australia "wikilink") animal,
[chromistan](chromista "wikilink"), fungal and plant species.[^234] All
these factors have led to Australia\'s having the highest mammal
extinction rate of any country in the world.[^235] The federal
*Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999* is the
legal framework for the protection of threatened species.[^236] Numerous
[protected areas](Protected_areas_of_Australia "wikilink") have been
created under the [National Strategy for the Conservation of
Australia\'s Biological Diversity](Biodiversity_action_plan "wikilink")
to protect and preserve unique ecosystems;[^237][^238] 65
[wetlands](wetland "wikilink") are
[listed](List_of_Ramsar_sites_in_Australia "wikilink") under the [Ramsar
Convention](Ramsar_Convention "wikilink"),[^239] and 16 natural [World
Heritage Sites](World_Heritage_Site "wikilink") have been
established.[^240] Australia was ranked 21st out of 178 countries in the
world on the 2018 [Environmental Performance
Index](Environmental_Performance_Index "wikilink").[^241] There are more
than 1,800 animals and plants on Australia\'s threatened species list,
including more than 500 animals.[^242]

[Paleontologists](Paleontologists "wikilink") discovered a
[fossil](fossil "wikilink") site of a
[prehistoric](prehistoric "wikilink")
[rainforest](rainforest "wikilink") in [McGraths
Flat](McGraths_Flat "wikilink"), in South Australia, that presents
evidence that this now arid [desert](desert "wikilink") and dry
[shrubland](shrubland "wikilink")/[grassland](grassland "wikilink") was
once home to an abundance of life.[^243][^244]

```
Australia is a [constitutional
monarchy](constitutional_monarchy "wikilink"), a [parliamentary
democracy](parliamentary_democracy "wikilink") and a
[federation](federation "wikilink").[^245] The country has maintained
its mostly unchanged
[constitution](Constitution_of_Australia "wikilink") alongside a stable
liberal democratic political system since
[Federation](Federation_of_Australia "wikilink") in 1901. It is one of
the world\'s oldest federations, in which power is divided between the
federal and [state and
territory](States_and_territories_of_Australia "wikilink") governments.
The [Australian system of government](Politics_of_Australia "wikilink")
combines elements derived from the political systems of the United
Kingdom (a [fused executive](Fusion_of_powers "wikilink"),
constitutional monarchy and [strong party
discipline](Party_discipline "wikilink")) and the United States
([federalism](federalism "wikilink"), a [written
constitution](written_constitution "wikilink") and [strong
bicameralism](bicameralism "wikilink") with an elected upper house),
resulting in a distinct hybrid.[^246][^247]

[Government power is partially
separated](Separation_of_powers_in_Australia "wikilink") between three
branches:[^248]

-   Legislature: the bicameral
    [Parliament](Parliament_of_Australia "wikilink"), comprising the
    [monarch](Monarchy_of_Australia "wikilink"), the
    [Senate](Australian_Senate "wikilink"), and the [House of
    Representatives](Australian_House_of_Representatives "wikilink");
-   Executive: the [Cabinet](Cabinet_of_Australia "wikilink"), led by
    the prime minister (the leader of the party or Coalition with a
    majority in the House of Representatives) and other ministers they
    have chosen. Formally appointed by the governor-general.[^249]
-   Judiciary: the [High Court](High_Court_of_Australia "wikilink") and
    other [federal courts](Australian_court_hierarchy "wikilink")

[Charles III](Charles_III "wikilink") reigns as [King of
Australia](King_of_Australia "wikilink") and is represented in Australia
by the [governor-general](Governor-General_of_Australia "wikilink") at
the federal level and by the
[governors](Governors_of_the_Australian_states "wikilink") at the state
level, who by [section
63](Chapter_II_of_the_Constitution_of_Australia#Section_63:_Provisions_referring_to_Governor-General "wikilink")
of the Constitution and convention act on the advice of their
ministers.[^250][^251] Thus, in practice the governor-general acts as a
legal figurehead for the actions of the [prime
minister](Prime_Minister_of_Australia "wikilink") and the Cabinet. The
governor-general may in some situations exercise powers in the absence
or contrary to ministerial advice using [reserve
powers](reserve_power "wikilink"). When these powers may be exercised is
governed by convention and their precise scope is unclear. The most
notable exercise of these powers was the dismissal of the [Whitlam
government](Whitlam_government "wikilink") in the [constitutional crisis
of 1975](1975_Australian_constitutional_crisis "wikilink").[^252]
![[Parliament House](Parliament_House,_Canberra "wikilink"),
[Canberra](Canberra "wikilink")](Canberra_(AU),_Parliament_House_--_2019_--_1746.jpg "Parliament House, Canberra")
In the Senate (the upper house), there are 76 senators: twelve each from
the states and two each from the mainland territories (the Australian
Capital Territory and the Northern Territory).[^253] The House of
Representatives (the lower house) has 151 members elected from
single-member [electoral
divisions](Divisions_of_the_Australian_House_of_Representatives "wikilink"),
commonly known as \"electorates\" or \"seats\", allocated to states on
the basis of population, with each of the current states guaranteed a
minimum of five seats.[^254] The lower house has a maximum term of three
years, but this is not fixed and governments usually dissolve the house
early for an election at some point in the 6 months before the
maximum.[^255] Elections for both chambers are generally held
simultaneously with senators having overlapping six-year terms except
for those from the territories, whose terms are not fixed but are tied
to the electoral cycle for the lower house. Thus only 40 of the 76
places in the Senate are put to each election unless the cycle is
interrupted by a [double
dissolution](double_dissolution "wikilink").[^256]

Australia\'s [electoral
system](electoral_system_of_Australia "wikilink") uses [preferential
voting](Instant-runoff_voting "wikilink") for the House of
Representatives and all state and territory lower house elections (with
the exception of Tasmania and the ACT which use the [Hare-Clark
system](Hare-Clark_system "wikilink")). The Senate and most state upper
houses use the \"[proportional
system](single_transferable_vote "wikilink")\" which combines
preferential voting with [proportional
representation](proportional_representation "wikilink") for each state.
[Voting and enrolment is compulsory](Compulsory_voting "wikilink") for
all enrolled citizens 18 years and over in every
jurisdiction.[^257][^258][^259] The party with majority support in the
House of Representatives forms the government and its leader becomes
Prime Minister. In cases where no party has majority support, the
governor-general has the constitutional power to appoint the prime
minister and, if necessary, dismiss one that has lost the confidence of
Parliament.[^260] Due to the relatively unique position of Australia
operating as a [Westminster](Westminster_system "wikilink")
parliamentary democracy with a powerful and elected upper house, the
system has sometimes been referred to as having a \"Washminster
mutation\",[^261] or as a [semi-parliamentary
system](semi-parliamentary_system "wikilink").[^262]

There are two major political groups that usually form government,
federally and in the states: the [Australian Labor
Party](Australian_Labor_Party "wikilink") and the
[Coalition](Coalition_(Australia) "wikilink"), which is a formal
grouping of the [Liberal Party](Liberal_Party_of_Australia "wikilink")
and its minor partner, the [National
Party](National_Party_of_Australia "wikilink").[^263][^264] The [Liberal
National Party](Liberal_National_Party_of_Queensland "wikilink") and the
[Country Liberal Party](Country_Liberal_Party "wikilink") are merged
state branches in Queensland and the Northern Territory that function as
separate parties at a federal level.[^265] Within Australian political
culture, the Coalition is considered
[centre-right](centre-right "wikilink") and the Labor Party is
considered [centre-left](centre-left "wikilink").[^266] Independent
members and several minor parties have achieved representation in
Australian parliaments, mostly in upper houses. The [Australian
Greens](Australian_Greens "wikilink") are often considered the \"third
force\" in politics, being the third largest party by both vote and
membership.[^267][^268]

The [most recent federal
election](2022_Australian_federal_election "wikilink") was held on 21
May 2022 and resulted in the Australian Labor Party, led by [Anthony
Albanese](Anthony_Albanese "wikilink"), being elected to
[government](Government_of_Australia "wikilink").[^269]

### States and territories {#states_and_territories}

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|States and territories of Australia}}
```
[thumb\|upright=1.75\|right\|A map of Australia\'s states and
territories](File:Australia_states_and_territories_labelled.svg "wikilink")

Australia has six states---[New South Wales](New_South_Wales "wikilink")
(NSW), [Victoria](Victoria_(state) "wikilink") (Vic),
[Queensland](Queensland "wikilink") (Qld), [Western
Australia](Western_Australia "wikilink") (WA), [South
Australia](South_Australia "wikilink") (SA) and
[Tasmania](Tasmania "wikilink") (Tas)---and two mainland self-governing
territories---the [Australian Capital
Territory](Australian_Capital_Territory "wikilink") (ACT) and the
[Northern Territory](Northern_Territory "wikilink") (NT).[^270]

The states have the general power to make laws except in the few areas
where the constitution grants the Commonwealth exclusive
powers.[^271][^272] The Commonwealth can only make laws on topics listed
in the constitution but its laws prevail over those of the states to the
extent of any inconsistency.[^273][^274] Since Federation, the
Commonwealth\'s power relative to the states [has significantly
increased](Australian_constitutional_law#Growth_of_federal_power "wikilink")
due to the increasingly wide interpretation given to listed Commonwealth
powers and because of the states\' [heavy financial
reliance](Fiscal_imbalance_in_Australia "wikilink") on Commonwealth
grants.[^275][^276]

Each state and major mainland territory has its own
[parliament](Parliaments_of_the_Australian_states_and_territories "wikilink")---[unicameral](unicameralism "wikilink")
in the Northern Territory, the ACT and Queensland, and bicameral in the
other states. The lower houses are known as the [Legislative
Assembly](Legislative_Assembly "wikilink") (the [House of
Assembly](House_of_Assembly "wikilink") in South Australia and
Tasmania); the upper houses are known as the [Legislative
Council](Legislative_council "wikilink"). The [head of the
government](head_of_government "wikilink") in each state is the
[Premier](Premiers_of_the_Australian_states "wikilink") and in each
territory the [Chief Minister](Chief_Minister "wikilink"). The King is
represented in each state by a
[governor](Governors_of_the_Australian_states "wikilink"). At the
Commonwealth level, the King\'s representative is the
governor-general.[^277]

The Commonwealth government directly administers the internal [Jervis
Bay Territory](Jervis_Bay_Territory "wikilink") and the other external
territories: the [Ashmore and Cartier
Islands](Ashmore_and_Cartier_Islands "wikilink"), the [Coral Sea
Islands](Coral_Sea_Islands "wikilink"), the [Heard Island and McDonald
Islands](Heard_Island_and_McDonald_Islands "wikilink"), the [Indian
Ocean territories](Australian_Indian_Ocean_Territories "wikilink")
(Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands), [Norfolk
Island](Norfolk_Island "wikilink"),`{{efn|Norfolk Island previously was self-governed, however this was revoked in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080806021653/http://ag.gov.au/www/agd/agd.nsf/Page/Territories_of_AustraliaNorfolk_IslandAdministrator_of_Norfolk_Island|url=http://ag.gov.au/www/agd/agd.nsf/Page/Territories_of_AustraliaNorfolk_Island|publisher=Australian Government Attorney-General's Department |title=Administrator of Norfolk Island |archive-date=6 August 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/may/12/norfolk-island-loses-its-parliament-as-canberra-takes-control |title=Norfolk Island loses its parliament as Canberra takes control|first1=Monica|last1=Tan|author2=Australian Associated Press |date=12 May 2015|newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=21 October 2015}}</ref>}}`{=mediawiki}

### Foreign relations {#foreign_relations}

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Foreign relations of Australia}}
```
[thumb\|left\|upright=1.3\|[Diplomatic missions of
Australia](List_of_diplomatic_missions_of_Australia "wikilink")](File:Diplomatic_missions_of_Australia.png "wikilink")
Australia is a [middle power](middle_power "wikilink"),[^282] whose
foreign relations has three core bi-partisan pillars: commitment to the
US alliance, engagement with the [Indo-Pacific](Indo-Pacific "wikilink")
and support for international institutions, rules and
co-operation.[^283][^284][^285] Through the [ANZUS](ANZUS "wikilink")
pact and its status as a [major non-NATO
ally](major_non-NATO_ally "wikilink"), Australia maintains a [close
relationship with the US](AustraliaUnited_States_relations "wikilink"),
which encompasses strong defence, security and trade ties.[^286][^287]
In the Indo-Pacific, the country seeks to increase its trade ties
through the open flow of trade and capital, whilst managing the rise of
Chinese power by supporting the existing rules based order.[^288]
Regionally, the country is a member of the [Pacific Islands
Forum](Pacific_Islands_Forum "wikilink"), the [Pacific
Community](Pacific_Community "wikilink"), the [ASEAN+6
mechanism](Association_of_Southeast_Asian_Nations#ASEAN_Plus_Three_and_ASEAN_Plus_Six "wikilink")
and the [East Asia Summit](East_Asia_Summit "wikilink").
Internationally, the country is a member of the [United
Nations](United_Nations "wikilink") (of which it was a founding member),
the [Commonwealth of Nations](Commonwealth_of_Nations "wikilink"), the
[OECD](OECD "wikilink") and the [G20](G20 "wikilink"). This reflects the
country\'s generally strong commitment to
[multilateralism](multilateralism "wikilink").[^289][^290]

Australia is a member of several defence, intelligence and security
groupings including the [Five Eyes](Five_Eyes "wikilink") intelligence
alliance with the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand;
the ANZUS alliance with the United States and New Zealand; the
[AUKUS](AUKUS "wikilink") security treaty with the United States and
United Kingdom; the [Quadrilateral Security
Dialogue](Quadrilateral_Security_Dialogue "wikilink") with the United
States, India and Japan; the [Five Power Defence
Arrangements](Five_Power_Defence_Arrangements "wikilink") with New
Zealand, the United Kingdom, Malaysia and Singapore; and the [Reciprocal
Access](Reciprocal_Access_Agreement "wikilink") defence and security
agreement with Japan.![Australian Prime Minister [Anthony

Australia has pursued the cause of international [trade
liberalisation](trade_liberalisation "wikilink").[^291] It led the
formation of the [Cairns Group](Cairns_Group "wikilink") and
[Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation](Asia-Pacific_Economic_Cooperation "wikilink"),[^292][^293]
and is a member of the [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development](OECD "wikilink") (OECD) and the [World Trade
Organization](World_Trade_Organization "wikilink") (WTO).[^294][^295]
Beginning in the 2000s, Australia has entered into the [Comprehensive
and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific
Partnership](Comprehensive_and_Progressive_Agreement_for_Trans-Pacific_Partnership "wikilink")
and the [Regional Comprehensive Economic
Partnership](Regional_Comprehensive_Economic_Partnership "wikilink")
multilateral [free trade agreements](free_trade_agreement "wikilink") as
well as bilateral free trade agreements with the [United
States](AustraliaUnited_States_Free_Trade_Agreement "wikilink"),
[China](ChinaAustralia_Free_Trade_Agreement "wikilink"),
[Japan](JapanAustralia_Economic_Partnership_Agreement "wikilink"),
[South Korea](AustraliaKorea_Free_Trade_Agreement "wikilink"),
[Indonesia](IndonesiaAustralia_Comprehensive_Economic_Partnership_Agreement "wikilink"),
the [United
Kingdom](AustraliaUnited_Kingdom_Free_Trade_Agreement "wikilink") and
[New Zealand](Closer_Economic_Relations "wikilink"), with the most
recent deal with UK signed in 2023.[^296]

Australia maintains a deeply integrated relationship with neighbouring
New Zealand, with free mobility of citizens between the two countries
under the [Trans-Tasman Travel
Arrangement](Trans-Tasman_Travel_Arrangement "wikilink") and free trade
under the Closer Economic Relations agreement.[^297] The most favourably
viewed countries by the Australian people in 2021 include New Zealand,
the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States
and South Korea.[^298] It also maintains an [international aid
program](International_aid "wikilink") under which some 75 countries
receive assistance.[^299] Australia ranked fourth in the [Center for
Global Development](Center_for_Global_Development "wikilink")\'s 2021
[Commitment to Development
Index](Commitment_to_Development_Index "wikilink").[^300]

The power over foreign policy is highly concentrated in the prime
minister and the [national security
committee](National_Security_Committee_(Australia) "wikilink"), with
major decision such as joining the [2003 invasion of
Iraq](2003_invasion_of_Iraq "wikilink") made with without prior Cabinet
approval.[^301][^302] Similarly, the Parliament does not play a formal
role in foreign policy and the power to declare war lies solely with the
executive government.[^303] The [Department of Foreign Affairs and
Trade](Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade "wikilink") supports the
executive in its policy decisions.

The two main institutions involved in the management of Australia\'s
armed forces are the [Australian Defence
Force](Australian_Defence_Force "wikilink") (ADF) and the [Department of
Defence](Department_of_Defence_(Australia) "wikilink"), together known
as \"[Defence](Australian_Defence_Organisation "wikilink")\".[^304] The
Australian Defence Force is the military wing, headed by the [chief of
the defence force](Chief_of_the_Defence_Force_(Australia) "wikilink"),
and contains three branches: the [Royal Australian
Navy](Royal_Australian_Navy "wikilink"), the [Australian
Army](Australian_Army "wikilink") and the [Royal Australian Air
Force](Royal_Australian_Air_Force "wikilink"). In 2021, it had 84,865
currently serving personnel (including 60,286 regulars and 24,581
reservists).[^305] The Department of Defence is the civilian wing and is
headed by the secretary of defence. These two leaders collective manage
Defence as a [diarchy](diarchy "wikilink"), with shared and joint
responsibilities.[^306] The titular role of
[commander-in-chief](Commander-in-Chief "wikilink") is held by the
[governor-general](Governor-General_of_Australia "wikilink"), however
actual command is vested in the chief of the Defence Force.[^307] The
executive branch of the Commonwealth government has overall control of
the military through the [minister of
defence](Minister_for_Defence_(Australia) "wikilink"), who is subject to
the decisions of Cabinet and its [National Security
Committee](National_Security_Committee_(Australia) "wikilink").[^308]

In 2022, defence spending was 1.9% of GDP, representing the world\'s
[13th largest defence
budget](List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures "wikilink").[^309] In
2024, the ADF had active operations in the Middle-East and the
Indo-Pacific (including security and aid provisions), was contributing
to UN forces in relation to [South
Sudan](United_Nations_Mission_in_South_Sudan "wikilink"),
[Syria-Israel](United_Nations_Disengagement_Observer_Force "wikilink")
and [North Korea](Operation_Argos "wikilink"), and domestically was
[assisting to prevent asylum-seekers enter the
country](Operation_Resolute "wikilink") and with [natural
disaster](natural_disaster "wikilink") relief.[^310]

Major [Australian intelligence
agencies](Australian_intelligence_agencies "wikilink") include the
[Australian Secret Intelligence
Service](Australian_Secret_Intelligence_Service "wikilink") (foreign
intelligence), the [Australian Signals
Directorate](Australian_Signals_Directorate "wikilink") (signals
intelligence) and the [Australian Security Intelligence
Organisation](Australian_Security_Intelligence_Organisation "wikilink")
(domestic security).

### Human rights {#human_rights}

```{=mediawiki}
{{See also|Human rights in Australia|LGBT rights in Australia}}
```
Legal and social rights in Australia are regarded as among the most
developed in the world.[^311] Attitudes towards LGBT people are
generally positive within Australia, and [same-sex
marriage](Same-sex_marriage_in_Australia "wikilink") has been legal in
the nation since 2017.[^312][^313] Australia has had anti-discrimination
laws regarding disability since 1992.[^314] However, international
organisations such as [Human Rights
Watch](Human_Rights_Watch "wikilink") and [Amnesty
International](Amnesty_International "wikilink") have expressed concerns
in areas including [asylum-seeker
policy](Immigration_detention_in_Australia "wikilink"), [Indigenous
deaths in custody](Indigenous_deaths_in_custody "wikilink"), the lack of
entrenched [rights protection](Charter_of_rights "wikilink") and [laws
restricting
protesting](Laws_governing_public_demonstrations_in_Australia "wikilink").[^315][^316]

also used by three island states in the Pacific:
[Kiribati](Kiribati "wikilink"), [Nauru](Nauru "wikilink"), and
[Tuvalu](Tuvalu "wikilink").[^323]

[Australian government debt](Australian_government_debt "wikilink"),
about \$963 billion in June 2022, exceeds 45.1% of the country\'s total
GDP, and is the world\'s
[eighth-highest](List_of_countries_by_government_debt "wikilink").[^324]
Australia had the [second-highest
level](List_of_countries_by_household_debt "wikilink") of [household
debt](household_debt "wikilink") in the world in 2020, after
Switzerland.[^325] [Its house
prices](Australian_property_market "wikilink") are among the highest in
the world, especially in the large urban areas.[^326] The large service
sector accounts for about 71.2% of total GDP, followed by the industrial
sector (25.3%), while the [agriculture
sector](Agriculture_in_Australia "wikilink") is by far the smallest,
making up only 3.6% of total GDP.[^327] Australia is the world\'s
[21st-largest exporter](List_of_countries_by_exports "wikilink") and
[24th-largest
importer](List_of_countries_by_imports "wikilink").[^328][^329] China is
Australia\'s [largest trading
partner](List_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_Australia "wikilink")
by a wide margin, accounting for roughly 40% of the country\'s exports
and 17.6% of its imports.[^330] Other major export markets include
Japan, the United States, and South Korea.[^331]

Australia has high levels of competitiveness and economic freedom, and
was ranked fifth in the [Human Development
Index](Human_Development_Index "wikilink") in 2021.[^332]
`{{As of|2022}}`{=mediawiki}, it is ranked twelfth in the [Index of
Economic Freedom](Index_of_Economic_Freedom "wikilink") and nineteenth
in the [Global Competitiveness
Report](Global_Competitiveness_Report "wikilink").[^333][^334] It
attracted 9.5 million international tourists in 2019,[^335] and was
[ranked thirteenth](World_Tourism_rankings "wikilink") among the
countries of [Asia-Pacific](Asia-Pacific "wikilink") in 2019 for inbound
tourism.[^336] The 2021 *[Travel and Tourism Competitiveness
Report](Travel_and_Tourism_Competitiveness_Report "wikilink")* ranked
Australia seventh-highest in the world out of 117 countries.[^337] Its
international tourism receipts in 2019 amounted to \$45.7 billion.[^338]

### Energy

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Energy policy of Australia|Renewable energy in Australia}}
```
In 2021--22, Australia\'s generation of electricity was sourced from
[black coal](Bituminous_coal "wikilink") (37.2%), [brown
coal](brown_coal "wikilink") (12%), [natural
gas](natural_gas "wikilink") (18.8%),
[hydro](Hydroelectricity "wikilink") (6.5%),
[wind](Wind_power "wikilink") (11.1%), [solar](Solar_power "wikilink")
(13.3%), [bio-energy](Bioenergy "wikilink") (1.2%) and others
(1.7%).[^339][^340] Total consumption of energy in this period was
sourced from coal (28.4%), oil (37.3%), gas (27.4%) and renewables
(7%).[^341] From 2012 to 2022, the energy sourced from renewables has
increased 5.7%, whilst energy sourced from coal has decreased 2.6%. The
use of gas also increased by 1.5% and the use of oil stayed relatively
stable with a reduction of only 0.2%.[^342]

In 2020, Australia produced 27.7% of its electricity from renewable
sources, exceeding the [target](Renewable_energy_target "wikilink") set
by the Commonwealth government in 2009 of 20% renewable energy by
2020.[^343][^344] A new target of 82% percent renewable energy by 2030
was set in 2022[^345] and a target for [net zero
emissions](net_zero_emissions "wikilink") by 2050 was set in 2021.[^346]

### Science and technology {#science_and_technology}

In 2019, Australia spent \$35.6 billion on [research and
development](research_and_development "wikilink"), allocating about
1.79% of GDP.[^347] A recent study by [Accenture](Accenture "wikilink")
for the Tech Council shows that the Australian tech sector combined
contributes \$167 billion a year to the economy and employs 861,000
people.[^348] In addition, recent [startup
ecosystems](startup_ecosystem "wikilink") in Sydney and Melbourne are
already valued at \$34 billion combined.[^349] Australia ranked 24th in
the [Global Innovation Index](Global_Innovation_Index "wikilink")
2023.[^350]

With only 0.3% of the world\'s population, Australia contributed 4.1% of
the world\'s published research in 2020, making it one of the top 10
research contributors in the world.[^351][^352]
[CSIRO](CSIRO "wikilink"), Australia\'s national science agency,
contributes 10% of all research in the country, while the rest is
carried out by universities.[^353] Its most notable contributions
include the invention of [atomic absorption
spectroscopy](atomic_absorption_spectroscopy "wikilink"),[^354] the
essential components of [Wi-Fi](Wi-Fi "wikilink") technology,[^355] and
the development of the first commercially successful [polymer
banknote](polymer_banknote "wikilink").[^356]

Australia is a key player in supporting [space
exploration](space_exploration "wikilink"). Facilities such as the
[Square Kilometre Array](Square_Kilometre_Array "wikilink") and
[Australia Telescope Compact
Array](Australia_Telescope_Compact_Array "wikilink") radio telescopes,
telescopes such as the [Siding Spring
Observatory](Siding_Spring_Observatory "wikilink"), and ground stations
such as the [Canberra Deep Space Communication
Complex](Canberra_Deep_Space_Communication_Complex "wikilink") are of
great assistance in deep space exploration missions, primarily by
[NASA](NASA "wikilink").[^357]

## Demographics

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Demographics of Australia}}
```
```{=mediawiki}
{{Main list|List of cities in Australia by population}}
```
Australia has an average [population
density](population_density "wikilink") of 3.4 persons per square
kilometre of total land area, which makes it one of the [most sparsely
populated countries in the
world](List_of_countries_by_population_density "wikilink"). The
population is heavily concentrated on the east coast, and in particular
in the south-eastern region between [South East
Queensland](South_East_Queensland "wikilink") to the north-east and
[Adelaide](Adelaide "wikilink") to the south-west.[^358]

Australia is also highly urbanised, with 67% of the population living in
the Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (metropolitan areas of the
state and mainland territorial capital cities) in 2018.[^359]
Metropolitan areas with more than one million inhabitants are
[Sydney](Sydney "wikilink"), [Melbourne](Melbourne "wikilink"),
[Brisbane](Brisbane "wikilink"), [Perth](Perth "wikilink") and
[Adelaide](Adelaide "wikilink").[^360]

In common with many other developed countries, Australia is experiencing
a demographic shift towards an older population, with more retirees and
fewer people of working age. In 2021 the [average
age](median_age "wikilink") of the population was 39 years.[^361] In
2015, 2.15% of the Australian population [lived
overseas](Australian_diaspora "wikilink"), one of the [lowest
proportions](List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_immigrant_population#UN_2015_report:_emigrant_population "wikilink")
worldwide.[^362]

### Ancestry and immigration {#ancestry_and_immigration}

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Immigration to Australia}}
```
[thumb\|upright=1.2\| Australian residents by country of birth, 2021
census](File:Australian_Residents_by_Country_of_Birth_2021_Census.svg "wikilink")
Between 1788 and the [Second World War](Second_World_War "wikilink"),
the vast majority of [settlers](settlers "wikilink") and
[immigrants](immigrants "wikilink") came from the [British
Isles](Anglo-Celtic_Australians "wikilink") (principally
[England](English_Australians "wikilink"),
[Ireland](Irish_Australians "wikilink") and
[Scotland](Scottish_Australians "wikilink")), although there was
significant immigration from [China](Chinese_Australians "wikilink") and
[Germany](German_Australians "wikilink") during the 19th century.
Following Federation in 1901, a strengthening of the [white Australia
policy](white_Australia_policy "wikilink") restricted further migration
from these areas. However, in the decades immediately following the
Second World War, Australia received a [large wave of
immigration](Post-war_immigration_to_Australia "wikilink") from across
[Europe](European_Australians "wikilink"), with many more immigrants
arriving from [Southern](Southern_Europe "wikilink") and [Eastern
Europe](Eastern_Europe "wikilink") than in previous decades. All overt
racial discrimination ended in 1973, with
[multiculturalism](Multiculturalism_in_Australia "wikilink") becoming
official policy.[^363] Subsequently, there has been a large and
continuing wave of immigration from across the world, with
[Asia](Asian_Australians "wikilink") being the largest source of
immigrants in the 21st century.[^364]

Today, Australia has the world\'s
[eighth-largest](List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_immigrant_population "wikilink")
immigrant population, with immigrants accounting for 30% of the
population, the [highest
proportion](List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_immigrant_population "wikilink")
among major [Western](Western_world "wikilink") nations.[^365][^366] In
2022--23, 212,789 permanent migrants were admitted to Australia, with a
net migration population gain of 518,000 people inclusive of
non-permanent residents.[^367][^368] Most entered on skilled
visas,[^369] however the immigration program also offers visas for
family members and [refugees](refugee "wikilink").[^370]

The [Australian Bureau of
Statistics](Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics "wikilink") does not collect
data on [race](race_(human_categorization) "wikilink"), but asks each
Australian resident to nominate up to two
[ancestries](ancestry "wikilink") each
[census](Census_in_Australia "wikilink").[^371] These ancestry responses
are classified into broad standardised ancestry groups.[^372] At the
2021 census, the number of ancestry responses within each standardised
group as a proportion of the total population was as follows:[^373]
57.2% [European](European_Australians "wikilink") (including 46%
[North-West
European](Northwestern_Europe#Ethnographic_definitions "wikilink") and
11.2% [Southern](Southern_Europe "wikilink") and [Eastern
European](Eastern_Europe "wikilink")), 33.8%

### Language

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Languages of Australia}}
```
Although English is not the official language of Australia in law, it is
the *[de facto](de_facto "wikilink")* official and national
language.[^376][^377] [Australian
English](Australian_English "wikilink") is a major variety of the
language with a distinctive accent and lexicon,[^378] and differs
slightly from other varieties of English in grammar and spelling.[^379]
[General Australian](General_Australian "wikilink") serves as the
standard dialect.[^380]

At the 2021 census, English was the only language spoken in the home for
72% of the population. The next most common languages spoken at home
were [Mandarin](Mandarin_Chinese "wikilink") (2.7%),
[Arabic](Arabic_language "wikilink") (1.4%),
[Vietnamese](Vietnamese_language "wikilink") (1.3%),
[Cantonese](Cantonese "wikilink") (1.2%) and
[Punjabi](Punjabi_language "wikilink") (0.9%).[^381]

Over 250 [Australian Aboriginal
languages](Australian_Aboriginal_languages "wikilink") are thought to
have existed at the time of first European contact.[^382] The National
Indigenous Languages Survey (NILS) for 2018--19 found that more than 120
Indigenous language varieties were in use or being revived, although 70
of those in use were endangered.[^383] The 2021 census found that 167
Indigenous languages were spoken at home by 76,978 Indigenous
Australians --- Yumplatok ([Torres Strait
Creole](Torres_Strait_Creole "wikilink")),
[Djambarrpuyngu](Djambarrpuyngu "wikilink") (a [Yolu
language](Yolu_languages "wikilink")) and
[Pitjantjatjara](Pitjantjatjara_dialect "wikilink") (a [Western Desert
language](Western_Desert_language "wikilink")) were among the most
widely spoken.[^384] NILS and the Australian Bureau of Statistics use
different classifications for Indigenous Australian languages.[^385]

The Australian sign language known as [Auslan](Auslan "wikilink") was
used at home by 16,242 people at the time of the 2021 census.[^386]

### Religion

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Religion in Australia}}
```
![Australia hosts a diversity of religions. [St Mary\'s
Cathedral](St_Mary's_Cathedral,_Sydney "wikilink") in Sydney belongs to
the [Roman Catholic Church](Catholic_Church "wikilink"), Australia\'s
largest religious
denomination.](St_Mary's_Cathedral_as_viewed_from_Hyde_Park,_Sydney.jpg "Australia hosts a diversity of religions. St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney belongs to the Roman Catholic Church, Australia's largest religious denomination.")
Australia has no [state religion](state_religion "wikilink"); section
116 of the [Australian Constitution](Australian_Constitution "wikilink")
prohibits the [Australian
government](Federal_Government_of_Australia "wikilink") from making any
law to establish any religion, impose any religious observance, or
prohibit the free exercise of any religion.[^387] However, the states
still retain the power to pass religiously discriminatory laws.[^388]

At the 2021 census, 38.9% of the population identified as having [\"no
religion\"](Irreligion_in_Australia "wikilink"),[^389] up from 15.5% in
2001.[^390] The largest religion is
[Christianity](Christianity "wikilink") (43.9% of the population).[^391]
The largest Christian denominations are the [Roman Catholic
Church](Catholic_Church_in_Australia "wikilink") (20% of the population)
and the [Anglican Church of
Australia](Anglican_Church_of_Australia "wikilink") (9.8%). Non-British
immigration since the [Second World War](Second_World_War "wikilink")
has led to the growth of non-Christian religions, the largest of which
are [Islam](Islam "wikilink") (3.2%), [Hinduism](Hinduism "wikilink")
(2.7%), [Buddhism](Buddhism "wikilink") (2.4%),
[Sikhism](Sikhism "wikilink") (0.8%), and [Judaism](Judaism "wikilink")
(0.4%).[^392][^393]

In 2021, just under 8,000 people declared an affiliation with
traditional Aboriginal religions.[^394] In [Australian Aboriginal
mythology](Australian_Aboriginal_mythology "wikilink") and the
[animist](animist "wikilink") framework developed in Aboriginal
Australia, the [Dreaming](Dreaming_(spirituality) "wikilink") is a
[sacred](sacred "wikilink") era in which ancestral
[totemic](totem "wikilink") spirit beings formed [The
Creation](Creation_myth "wikilink"). The Dreaming established the laws
and structures of society and the ceremonies performed to ensure
continuity of life and land.[^395]

### Health

```{=mediawiki}
{{See also|Health care in Australia}}
```
Australia\'s life expectancy of 83 years (81 years for males and 85
years for females),[^396] is the [fifth-highest in the
world](List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy "wikilink"). It has the
highest rate of skin cancer in the world,[^397] while [cigarette
smoking](Tobacco_smoking "wikilink") is the largest preventable cause of
death and disease, responsible for 7.8% of the total mortality and
disease. Ranked second in preventable causes is
[hypertension](hypertension "wikilink") at 7.6%, with obesity third at
7.5%.[^398][^399] Australia ranked 35th in the world in 2012 for its
proportion of obese women[^400] and near the top of [developed
nations](Developed_country "wikilink") for its proportion of
[obese](Obesity_in_Australia "wikilink") adults;[^401] 63% of its adult
population is either overweight or obese.[^402]

Australia spent around 9.91% of its total GDP to health care in
2021.[^403] It introduced a [national insurance
scheme](National_health_insurance "wikilink") in 1975.[^404] Following a
period in which access to the scheme was restricted, the scheme became
[universal](Universal_health_care "wikilink") once more in 1981 under
the name of [Medicare](Medicare_(Australia) "wikilink").[^405] The
program is nominally funded by an income tax surcharge known as the
[Medicare levy](Medicare_levy "wikilink"), currently at 2%.[^406] The
states manage hospitals and attached outpatient services, while the
Commonwealth funds the [Pharmaceutical Benefits
Scheme](Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Scheme "wikilink") (subsidising the
costs of medicines) and [general
practice](general_practice "wikilink").[^407]

### Education

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Education in Australia}}
```
![Australia has the highest ratio of international students per capita
in the world, with Melbourne ranking fifth among the 2023 *[QS Best
Student
Cities](QS_World_University_Rankings#QS_Best_Student_Cities "wikilink")*
([University of Melbourne](University_of_Melbourne "wikilink")
pictured).](Parkville_-_University_of_Melbourne_(Ormond_College).jpg "Australia has the highest ratio of international students per capita in the world, with Melbourne ranking fifth among the 2023 QS Best Student Cities (University of Melbourne pictured).")
School attendance, or registration for [home
schooling](Homeschooling_in_Australia "wikilink"),[^408] is compulsory
throughout Australia. Education is primarily the responsibility of the
individual states and territories, however the Commonwealth has
significant influence through funding agreements.[^409] Since 2014, a
[national curriculum](Australian_Curriculum "wikilink") developed by the
Commonwealth has been implemented by the states and territories.[^410]
Attendance rules vary between states, but in general children are
required to attend school from the age of about 5 until about
16.[^411][^412] In some states (Western Australia, Northern Territory
and New South Wales), children aged 16--17 are required to either attend
school or participate in vocational training, such as an
[apprenticeship](apprenticeship "wikilink").[^413][^414][^415][^416]

Australia has an adult literacy rate that was estimated to be 99% in
2003.[^417] However, a 2011--2012 report for the Australian Bureau of
Statistics found that 44% of the population does not have high literary
and numeracy competence levels, interpreted by others as suggesting that
they do not have the \"skills needed for everyday
life\".[^418][^419][^420]

Australia has 37 government-funded universities and three private
universities, as well as a number of other specialist institutions that
provide approved courses at the higher education level.[^421] The OECD
places Australia among the most expensive nations to attend
university.[^422] There is a state-based system of vocational training,
known as [TAFE](Technical_and_further_education "wikilink"), and many
trades conduct apprenticeships for training new tradespeople.[^423]
About 58% of Australians aged from 25 to 64 have vocational or tertiary
qualifications[^424] and the tertiary graduation rate of 49% is the
highest among OECD countries. 30.9% of Australia\'s population has
attained a higher education qualification, which is among the highest
percentages in the world.[^425][^426][^427]

Australia has the highest ratio of [international
students](International_students_in_Australia "wikilink") per head of
population in the world by a large margin, with 812,000 international
students enrolled in the nation\'s universities and vocational
institutions in 2019.[^428][^429] Accordingly, in 2019, international
students represented on average 26.7% of the student bodies of
Australian universities. International education therefore represents
one of the country\'s largest exports and has a pronounced influence on
the country\'s demographics, with a significant proportion of
international students remaining in Australia after graduation on
various skill and employment visas.[^430] Education is Australia\'s
third-largest export, after iron ore and coal, and contributed over \$28
billion to the economy in 2016--17.[^431]

## Culture

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Culture of Australia}}
```
![The [Sydney Opera House](Sydney_Opera_House "wikilink") was completed
in 1973 and declared a UNESCO [World Heritage
Site](World_Heritage_Site "wikilink") in 2007, making it the youngest
building to ever receive the
designation.[^432]](Sydney_Opera_House,_botanic_gardens_1.jpg "The Sydney Opera House was completed in 1973 and declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007, making it the youngest building to ever receive the designation.")
Contemporary Australian culture reflects the country\'s [Indigenous
traditions](Australian_Aboriginal_culture "wikilink"),
[Anglo-Celtic](Anglo-Celtic "wikilink") heritage, and post 1970s history
of [multicultural
immigration](multiculturalism_in_Australia "wikilink").[^434][^435][^436]
The [culture of the United
States](culture_of_the_United_States "wikilink") has also been
influential.[^437] The evolution of Australian culture since British
colonisation has given rise to distinctive cultural traits.[^438][^439]

Many Australians identify egalitarianism,
[mateship](mateship "wikilink"), irreverence and a lack of formality as
part of their national identity.[^440][^441][^442] These find expression
in [Australian slang](Australian_slang "wikilink"), as well as
[Australian humour](Australian_comedy "wikilink"), which is often
characterised as dry, irreverent and ironic.[^443][^444] New citizens
and visa holders are required to commit to \"Australian values\", which
are identified by the [Department of Home
Affairs](Department_of_Home_Affairs_(Australia) "wikilink") as
including: a respect for the freedom of the individual; recognition of
the rule of law; opposition to racial, gender and religious
discrimination; and an understanding of the \"[fair
go](:wikt:fair_go "wikilink")\", which is said to encompass the equality
of opportunity for all and compassion for those in need.[^445] What
these values mean, and whether or not Australians uphold them, has been
debated since before Federation.[^446][^447][^448][^449]

### Arts

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Australian art|Australian literature|Theatre of Australia|Dance in Australia}}
```
![Held at the [Museum of Old and New
Art](Museum_of_Old_and_New_Art "wikilink") in Hobart, Tasmania, [Sidney
Nolan](Sidney_Nolan "wikilink")\'s *[Snake](Snake_(Nolan) "wikilink")*
mural (1970) is inspired by the Aboriginal creation myth of the [Rainbow
Serpent](Rainbow_Serpent "wikilink"), as well as desert flowers in bloom
after a
drought.[^450]](Sidney_Nolan_Snake.jpg "Held at the Museum of Old and New Art in Hobart, Tasmania, Sidney Nolan's Snake mural (1970) is inspired by the Aboriginal creation myth of the Rainbow Serpent, as well as desert flowers in bloom after a drought.")
Australia has over 100,000 [Aboriginal rock
art](Indigenous_Australian_art#Stone_art "wikilink") sites,[^452] and
traditional designs, patterns and stories infuse [contemporary
Indigenous Australian
art](contemporary_Indigenous_Australian_art "wikilink"), \"the last
great art movement of the 20th century\" according to critic [Robert
Hughes](Robert_Hughes_(critic) "wikilink");[^453] its exponents include
[Emily Kame Kngwarreye](Emily_Kame_Kngwarreye "wikilink").[^454] Early
colonial artists showed a fascination with the unfamiliar land.[^455]
The [impressionistic](impressionism "wikilink") works of [Arthur
Streeton](Arthur_Streeton "wikilink"), [Tom
Roberts](Tom_Roberts "wikilink") and other members of the 19th-century
[Heidelberg School](Heidelberg_School "wikilink")---the first
\"distinctively Australian\" movement in Western art---gave expression
to nationalist sentiments in the lead-up to Federation.[^456] While the
school remained influential into the 1900s,
[modernists](modern_art "wikilink") such as [Margaret
Preston](Margaret_Preston "wikilink") and [Clarice
Beckett](Clarice_Beckett "wikilink"), and, later, [Sidney
Nolan](Sidney_Nolan "wikilink"), explored new artistic trends.[^457] The
landscape remained central to the work of Aboriginal watercolourist
[Albert Namatjira](Albert_Namatjira "wikilink"),[^458] as well as [Fred
Williams](Fred_Williams_(artist) "wikilink"), [Brett
Whiteley](Brett_Whiteley "wikilink") and other post-war artists whose
works, eclectic in style yet uniquely Australian, moved between the
[figurative](figurative_art "wikilink") and the
[abstract](abstract_art "wikilink").[^459][^460]

[Australian literature](Australian_literature "wikilink") grew slowly in
the decades following European settlement though Indigenous [oral
traditions](oral_tradition "wikilink"), many of which have since been
recorded in writing, are much older.[^461] In the 19th century, [Henry
Lawson](Henry_Lawson "wikilink") and [Banjo
Paterson](Banjo_Paterson "wikilink") captured the experience of [the
bush](Australian_bush "wikilink") using a distinctive Australian
vocabulary.[^462] Their works are still popular; Paterson\'s [bush
poem](bush_poetry "wikilink") \"[Waltzing
Matilda](Waltzing_Matilda "wikilink")\" (1895) is regarded as
Australia\'s unofficial national anthem.[^463] [Miles
Franklin](Miles_Franklin "wikilink") is the namesake of Australia\'s
[most prestigious literary prize](Miles_Franklin_Award "wikilink"),
awarded annually to the best novel about Australian life.[^464] Its
first recipient, [Patrick White](Patrick_White "wikilink"), went on to
win the [Nobel Prize in
Literature](Nobel_Prize_in_Literature "wikilink") in 1973.[^465]
Australian [Booker Prize](Booker_Prize "wikilink") winners include
[Peter Carey](Peter_Carey_(novelist) "wikilink"), [Thomas
Keneally](Thomas_Keneally "wikilink") and [Richard
Flanagan](Richard_Flanagan "wikilink").[^466] Australian public
intellectuals have also written seminal works in their respective
fields, including feminist [Germaine Greer](Germaine_Greer "wikilink")
and philosopher [Peter Singer](Peter_Singer "wikilink").[^467]

![Arising from the [Australian pub
rock](Pub_rock_(Australia) "wikilink") scene, [AC/DC](AC/DC "wikilink")
ranks among the [world\'s best-selling music
acts](List_of_best-selling_music_artists "wikilink").](ACDC-Hughes-long_ago.jpg "Arising from the Australian pub rock scene, AC/DC ranks among the world's best-selling music acts.")
In the performing arts, Aboriginal peoples have traditions of religious
and secular song, dance and rhythmic music often performed in
[corroborees](corroboree "wikilink").[^468] At the beginning of the 20th
century, [Nellie Melba](Nellie_Melba "wikilink") was one of the world\'s
leading opera singers,[^469] and later popular music acts such as the
[Bee Gees](Bee_Gees "wikilink"), [AC/DC](AC/DC "wikilink"),
[INXS](INXS "wikilink") and [Kylie Minogue](Kylie_Minogue "wikilink")
achieved international recognition.[^470] Many of Australia\'s
performing arts companies receive funding through the Australian
government\'s [Australia
Council](Australia_Council_for_the_Arts "wikilink").[^471] There is a
symphony orchestra in each state,[^472] and a national opera company,
[Opera Australia](Opera_Australia "wikilink"),[^473] well known for its
famous [soprano](soprano "wikilink") [Joan
Sutherland](Joan_Sutherland "wikilink").[^474] Ballet and dance are
represented by [The Australian Ballet](The_Australian_Ballet "wikilink")
and various state companies. Each state has a publicly funded theatre
company.[^475]

### Media

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Cinema of Australia|Television in Australia|Media of Australia|Music of Australia}}
```
![Actor playing the [bushranger](bushranger "wikilink") and outlaw [Ned
Kelly](Ned_Kelly "wikilink") in *[The Story of the Kelly
Gang](The_Story_of_the_Kelly_Gang "wikilink")* (1906), the world\'s
first feature-length narrative
film](The_Story_of_the_Kelly_Gang_1906.jpg "Actor playing the bushranger and outlaw Ned Kelly in The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906), the world's first feature-length narrative film")
*[The Story of the Kelly Gang](The_Story_of_the_Kelly_Gang "wikilink")*
(1906), the world\'s first [feature-length](feature_film "wikilink")
narrative film, spurred a boom in [Australian
cinema](cinema_of_Australia "wikilink") during the [silent
film](silent_film "wikilink") era.[^476] After World War I,
[Hollywood](Hollywood_(film_industry) "wikilink") monopolised the
industry,[^477] and by the 1960s Australian film production had
effectively ceased.[^478] With the benefit of government support, the
[Australian New Wave](Australian_New_Wave "wikilink") of the 1970s
brought provocative and successful films, many exploring themes of
national identity, such as *[Picnic at Hanging
Rock](Picnic_at_Hanging_Rock_(film) "wikilink")*, *[Wake in
Fright](Wake_in_Fright "wikilink")* and
*[Gallipoli](Gallipoli_(1981_film) "wikilink")*,[^479] while *[Crocodile
Dundee](Crocodile_Dundee "wikilink")* and the
[Ozploitation](Ozploitation "wikilink") movement\'s *[Mad
Max](Mad_Max_(franchise) "wikilink")* series became international
blockbusters.[^480] In a film market flooded with foreign content,
Australian films delivered a 7.7% share of the local box office in
2015.[^481] The [AACTAs](AACTA_Awards "wikilink") are Australia\'s
premier film and television awards, and notable [Academy Award winners
from
Australia](List_of_Australian_Academy_Award_winners_and_nominees "wikilink")
include [Geoffrey Rush](Geoffrey_Rush "wikilink"), [Nicole
Kidman](Nicole_Kidman "wikilink"), [Cate
Blanchett](Cate_Blanchett "wikilink") and [Heath
Ledger](Heath_Ledger "wikilink").[^482]

Australia has two public broadcasters (the [Australian Broadcasting
Corporation](Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation "wikilink") and the
multicultural [Special Broadcasting
Service](Special_Broadcasting_Service "wikilink")), three commercial
television networks, several pay-TV services,[^483] and numerous public,
non-profit television and radio stations. Each major city has at least
one daily newspaper,[^484] and there are two national daily newspapers,
*[The Australian](The_Australian "wikilink")* and *[The Australian
Financial Review](The_Australian_Financial_Review "wikilink")*.[^485] In
2020, [Reporters Without Borders](Reporters_Without_Borders "wikilink")
placed Australia 25th on a list of 180 countries ranked by [press
freedom](freedom_of_the_press "wikilink"), behind New Zealand (8th) but
ahead of the United Kingdom (33rd) and United States (44th).[^486] This
relatively low ranking is primarily because of the limited diversity of
commercial media ownership in Australia;[^487] most print media are
under the control of [News Corporation](News_Corporation "wikilink")
(59%) and [Nine Entertainment Co](Nine_Entertainment_Co. "wikilink")
(23%).[^488]

### Cuisine

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Australian cuisine}}
```
![[South Australian
wines](South_Australian_wine "wikilink")](Shiraz_Wein.jpg "South Australian wines")
Most Indigenous Australian groups subsisted on a
[hunter-gatherer](hunter-gatherer "wikilink") diet of native fauna and
flora, otherwise called [bush tucker](bush_tucker "wikilink").[^489] It
has increased in popularity among non-Indigenous Australians since the
1970s, with examples such as [lemon
myrtle](Backhousia_citriodora "wikilink"), the [macadamia
nut](Macadamia "wikilink") and [kangaroo meat](kangaroo_meat "wikilink")
now widely available.[^490][^491]

The first colonists introduced [British](British_cuisine "wikilink") and
[Irish cuisine](Irish_cuisine "wikilink") to the continent.[^492][^493]
This influence is seen in dishes such as [fish and
chips](fish_and_chips "wikilink"), and in the [Australian meat
pie](Meat_pie_(Australia_and_New_Zealand) "wikilink"), which is related
to the British [steak pie](steak_pie "wikilink"). Also during the
colonial period, Chinese migrants paved the way for a distinctive
[Australian Chinese
cuisine](Australian_Chinese_cuisine "wikilink").[^494]

Post-war migrants transformed Australian cuisine, bringing with them
their culinary traditions and contributing to new
[fusion](fusion_cuisine "wikilink") dishes.[^495] Italians introduced
espresso coffee and, along with Greeks, helped develop Australia\'s caf
culture, of which the [flat white](flat_white "wikilink") and \"[smashed
avo](avocado_toast "wikilink")\" on toast are now considered Australian
staples.[^496][^497] [Pavlovas](pavlova_(food) "wikilink"),
[lamingtons](lamington "wikilink"), [Vegemite](Vegemite "wikilink") and
[Anzac biscuits](Anzac_biscuits "wikilink") are also often called iconic
Australian foods.[^498]

Australia is a leading exporter and consumer of
[wine](wine "wikilink").[^499] [Australian
wine](Australian_wine "wikilink") is produced mainly in the southern,
cooler parts of the country.[^500] The nation also ranks highly in [beer
consumption](List_of_countries_by_beer_consumption_per_capita "wikilink"),[^501]
with each state and territory hosting numerous breweries.

### Sport and recreation {#sport_and_recreation}

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Sport in Australia}}
```
![The [Melbourne Cricket Ground](Melbourne_Cricket_Ground "wikilink") is
strongly associated with the history and development of
[cricket](cricket "wikilink") and [Australian rules
football](Australian_rules_football "wikilink"), Australia\'s two most
popular spectator
sports.[^502]](2017_AFL_Grand_Final_panorama_during_national_anthem.jpg "The Melbourne Cricket Ground is strongly associated with the history and development of cricket and Australian rules football, Australia's two most popular spectator sports.")
[Cricket](Cricket "wikilink") and [football](football "wikilink") are
the predominant sports in Australia during the summer and winter months,
respectively. Australia is unique in that it has professional leagues
for [four football codes](football_in_Australia "wikilink"), whose
relative popularity is [divided
geographically](Barassi_Line "wikilink").[^504] Originating in Melbourne
in the 1850s, [Australian rules
football](Australian_rules_football "wikilink") is the most popular code
in all states except New South Wales and Queensland, where [rugby
league](rugby_league "wikilink") holds sway, followed by [rugby
union](rugby_union "wikilink").[^505]
[Soccer](Association_football "wikilink"), while ranked fourth in
popularity and resources, has the highest overall participation
rates.[^506] Cricket is popular across all borders and has been regarded
by many Australians as the [national sport](national_sport "wikilink").
The [Australian national cricket
team](Australia_national_cricket_team "wikilink") competed against
[England](England_cricket_team "wikilink") in the first
[Test](Test_cricket "wikilink") match (1877) and the first [One Day
International](One_Day_International "wikilink") (1971), and against
[New Zealand](New_Zealand_cricket_team "wikilink") in the first
[Twenty20 International](Twenty20_International "wikilink") (2004),
winning all three games. It has also participated in every edition of
the [Cricket World Cup](Cricket_World_Cup "wikilink"), winning the
tournament a record six times.[^507]

Australia is one of five nations to have participated in every [Summer
Olympics](Summer_Olympics "wikilink") of the modern era,[^508] and has
hosted the Games twice: [1956](1956_Summer_Olympics "wikilink") in
Melbourne and [2000](2000_Summer_Olympics "wikilink") in Sydney.[^509]
It is also set to host the [2032 Games](2032_Summer_Olympics "wikilink")
in Brisbane.[^510] Australia has also participated in every
[Commonwealth Games](Commonwealth_Games "wikilink"),[^511] hosting the
event in [1938](1938_British_Empire_Games "wikilink"),
[1962](1962_British_Empire_and_Commonwealth_Games "wikilink"),
[1982](1982_Commonwealth_Games "wikilink"),
[2006](2006_Commonwealth_Games "wikilink") and
[2018](2018_Commonwealth_Games "wikilink").[^512] As well as being a
regular [FIFA World Cup](FIFA_World_Cup "wikilink") participant,
[Australia](Australia_men's_national_soccer_team "wikilink") has won the
[OFC Nations Cup](OFC_Nations_Cup "wikilink") four times and the [AFC
Asian Cup](AFC_Asian_Cup "wikilink") once---the only country to have won
championships in two different FIFA confederations.[^513]

Other major international events held in Australia include the
[Australian Open](Australian_Open "wikilink") tennis [grand
slam](Grand_Slam_(tennis) "wikilink") tournament and the [Formula One
Australian Grand Prix](Australian_Grand_Prix "wikilink"). The annual
[Melbourne Cup](Melbourne_Cup "wikilink") horse race and the [Sydney to
Hobart](Sydney_to_Hobart_Yacht_Race "wikilink") yacht race also attract
intense interest.[^514] Australia is also notable for water-based
sports, such as swimming and
[surfing](surfing_in_Australia "wikilink").[^515] The [surf
lifesaving](surf_lifesaving "wikilink") movement originated in
Australia, and the volunteer lifesaver is one of the country\'s
icons.[^516] [Snow
sports](Winter_sport_in_Australia#Snow_sport "wikilink") take place
primarily in the [Australian Alps](Australian_Alps "wikilink") and
Tasmania.[^517]

officially the **Republic of Albania**
(`{{lang-sq|Republika e Shqipris|link=no}}`{=mediawiki}),`{{efn|{{IPA-sq|publika  cipis|pron}}.}}`{=mediawiki}
is a country in [Southeast Europe](Southeast_Europe "wikilink"). The
country is located in the [Balkans](Balkans "wikilink") on the
[Adriatic](Adriatic_Sea "wikilink") and [Ionian
Seas](Ionian_Sea "wikilink") within the [Mediterranean
Sea](Mediterranean_Sea "wikilink") and shares [land
borders](land_border "wikilink") with
[Montenegro](Montenegro "wikilink") to the northwest,
[Kosovo](Kosovo "wikilink") to the northeast, [North
Macedonia](North_Macedonia "wikilink") to the east and
[Greece](Greece "wikilink") to the south. Spanning an area of
`{{convert|28748|sqkm|abbr=on}}`{=mediawiki}, it displays a varied range
of climatic, geological, hydrological and morphological conditions. The
country\'s landscapes range from rugged snow-capped mountains in the
[Albanian Alps](Accursed_Mountains "wikilink") and the
[Korab](Korab "wikilink"),
[Skanderbeg](Central_Mountain_Range,_Albania#Skanderbeg_Mountains "wikilink"),
[Pindus](Pindus "wikilink") and [Ceraunian
Mountains](Ceraunian_Mountains "wikilink"), to fertile lowland plains
extending from the coasts of the
[Adriatic](Albanian_Adriatic_Sea_Coast "wikilink") and
[Ionian](Albanian_Ionian_Sea_Coast "wikilink") seas.
[Tirana](Tirana "wikilink") is the capital and largest city in the
country, followed by [Durrs](Durrs "wikilink"),
[Vlor](Vlor "wikilink"), and [Shkodr](Shkodr "wikilink").

In ancient times, the [Illyrians](Illyrians "wikilink") inhabited
northern and central regions of Albania, whilst
[Epirotes](Epirotes "wikilink") inhabited the south. Several important
ancient [Greek colonies](Greek_colonisation "wikilink") were also
established on the coast. The [Illyrian
kingdom](Illyrian_kingdom "wikilink") centered in what is now Albania
was the dominant power before the [Rise of
Macedon](Rise_of_Macedon "wikilink").[^1] In the 2nd century BCE, the
region was annexed by the [Roman Republic](Roman_Republic "wikilink"),
and after the division of the [Roman Empire](Roman_Empire "wikilink") it
became part of [Byzantium](Byzantine_Empire "wikilink"). The first known
[Albanian](Albanians "wikilink") autonomous principality --
[Arbanon](Arbanon "wikilink") -- was established in the 12th century.
The [Kingdom of Albania](Kingdom_of_Albania_(medieval) "wikilink"),
[Principality of Albania](Principality_of_Albania_(medieval) "wikilink")
and [Albania Veneta](Albania_Veneta "wikilink") were formed between the
13th and 15th centuries in different parts of the country, alongside
other Albanian principalities and political entities. In the late 15th
century, Albania [became part](Ottoman_Albania "wikilink") of the
[Ottoman Empire](Ottoman_Empire "wikilink") until 1912, when the modern
Albanian state [declared
independence](Declaration_of_independence_of_Albania "wikilink"). In
1939, [Italy](Kingdom_of_Italy "wikilink") invaded the [Kingdom of
Albania](Kingdom_of_Albania_(192839) "wikilink"), which became [Greater
Albania](Albanian_Kingdom_(193943) "wikilink"), and then a
[protectorate](Albanian_Kingdom_(194344) "wikilink") of [Nazi
Germany](Nazi_Germany "wikilink") during [World War
II](World_War_II "wikilink").[^2] Following the war, the [People\'s
Socialist Republic of
Albania](People's_Socialist_Republic_of_Albania "wikilink") was formed,
which lasted until the [Revolutions of
1991](Revolutions_of_1989 "wikilink") concluded with the [fall of
communism in Albania](fall_of_communism_in_Albania "wikilink") and
eventually the establishment of the current Republic of Albania.

Since its independence in 1912, Albania has undergone a diverse
political evolution, transitioning from a
[monarchy](monarchy "wikilink") to a [communist
regime](Communism "wikilink") before becoming a
[sovereign](sovereign_state "wikilink")
[parliamentary](parliamentary_republic "wikilink") [constitutional
republic](constitutional_republic "wikilink"). Governed by a
[constitution](Constitution_of_Albania "wikilink") prioritising the
separation of powers, the country\'s political structure includes a
[parliament](Parliament_of_Albania "wikilink"), a ceremonial
[president](President_of_Albania "wikilink"), a functional [prime
minister](Prime_Minister_of_Albania "wikilink") and a hierarchy of
courts. Albania is a [developing country](developing_country "wikilink")
with an [upper-middle
income](List_of_countries_by_GNI_(nominal,_Atlas_method)_per_capita#Upper-middle-income_group "wikilink")
[economy](Economy_of_Albania "wikilink") driven by the service sector,
with manufacturing and [tourism](Tourism_in_Albania "wikilink") also
playing significant roles.[^3] The country underwent a transition post
the dissolution of communism, shifting from a [centralised
planning](planned_economy "wikilink") to adopting a
[open](open_market "wikilink") [market
economy](market_economy "wikilink").[^4] Citizens in Albania benefit
from [universal health care](universal_health_care "wikilink") access
and receive complimentary primary and secondary education.

## Name

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Names of the Albanians and Albania}}
```
The historical origins of the term \"Albania\" can be traced back to
[medieval Latin](medieval_Latin "wikilink"), with its foundations
believed to be associated with the [Illyrian
tribe](Illyrian_tribe "wikilink") of the
[Albani](Albani_(Illyrian_tribe) "wikilink"). This connection gains
further support from the work of the Ancient Greek geographer
[Ptolemy](Ptolemy "wikilink") during the 2nd century AD, where he
included the settlement of [Albanopolis](Albanopolis "wikilink")
situated to the northeast of [Durrs](Durrs "wikilink").[^5][^6] The
presence of a medieval settlement named
[Albanon](Principality_of_Arbanon "wikilink") or Arbanon hints at the
possibility of historical continuity. However, the precise relationship
between these historical references and the question of whether
Albanopolis was synonymous with Albanon remains a subject of scholarly
debate.[^7]

The Byzantine historian [Michael
Attaliates](Michael_Attaliates "wikilink"), in his 11th century
historical account, provides the earliest undisputed reference to the
Albanians, when he mentions them having taken part in a revolt against
[Constantinople](Constantinople "wikilink") in 1079.[^8] Additionally,
he identified the Arbanitai as subjects under the governance of the Duke
of [Dyrrachium](Durrs "wikilink").[^9] In the Middle Ages, Albania was
denoted as `{{lang|sq|Arbri|i=yes}}`{=mediawiki} or
`{{lang|sq|Arbni|i=yes}}`{=mediawiki} by its inhabitants, who
identified themselves as `{{lang|sq|Arbresh|i=yes}}`{=mediawiki} or
`{{lang|sq|Arbnesh|i=yes}}`{=mediawiki}.[^10] Albanians employ the
terms `{{lang|sq|Shqipri|i=yes}}`{=mediawiki} or
`{{lang|sq|Shqipria|i=yes}}`{=mediawiki} when referring to their
nation, designations that trace their historical origins to the 14th
century.[^11] However, it was not until the late 17th and early 18th
centuries that these terms gradually superseded
`{{lang|sq|Arbria|i=yes}}`{=mediawiki} and
`{{lang|sq|Arbresh|i=yes}}`{=mediawiki} among the Albanians.[^12][^13]
These two expressions are widely interpreted to symbolise \"Children of
the Eagles\" and \"Land of the Eagles\".[^14][^15]

### Prehistory

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Prehistoric Albania|l1=Prehistory of Albania}}
```
![The remains of the [Kamenica Tumulus](Kamenica_Tumulus "wikilink") in
the [county of
Kor](county_of_Kor "wikilink").](Kamenic_Tumulus,_Albania_2018_02.jpg "The remains of the Kamenica Tumulus in the county of Kor.")

Mesolithic habitation in Albania has been evidenced in several open air
sites which during that period were close to the Adriatic coastline and
in cave sites. Mesolithic objects found in a cave near Xarr include
[flint](flint "wikilink") and [jasper](jasper "wikilink") objects along
with fossilised animal bones, while those discoveries at Mount Dajt
comprise bone and stone tools similar to those of the [Aurignacian
culture](Aurignacian_culture "wikilink").[^16] The
[Neolithic](Neolithic "wikilink") era in Albania began around 7000 BCE
and is evidenced in finds which indicate domestication of sheep and
goats and small-scale agriculture. A part of the Neolithic population
may have been the same as the Mesolithic population of the southern
Balkans like in the [Konispol](Konispol "wikilink") cave where the
Mesolithic stratum co-exists with Pre-Pottery Neolithic finds. [Cardium
pottery](Cardium_pottery "wikilink") culture appears in coastal Albania
and across the Adriatic after 6500 BCE, while the settlements of the
interior took part in the processes which formed [Starevo
culture](Starevo_culture "wikilink").[^17] The Albanian
[bitumen](bitumen "wikilink") mines of [Selenic](Selenic "wikilink")
provide early evidence of bitumen exploitation in Europe, dating to Late
Neolithic Albania (from 5000 BCE), when local communities used it as
pigment for ceramic decoration,
[waterproofing](waterproofing "wikilink"), and
[adhesive](adhesive "wikilink") for reparing broken vessels. The bitumen
of Selenic circulated towards eastern Albania from the early 5th
millennium BCE. First evidence of its overseas trade export comes from
Neolithic and Bronze Age southern [Italy](Italy "wikilink"). The high
quality bitumen of Selenic has been exploited throughout all the
historical ages since the Late Neolithic era until today.[^18]

The [Indo-Europeanization](Indo-European_migrations "wikilink") of
Albania in the context of the IE-ization of the western Balkans began
after 2800 BCE. The presence of the Early Bronze Age
[tumuli](Tumulus "wikilink") in the vicinity of later
[Apollonia](Apollonia_(Illyria) "wikilink") dates to 2679174 calBCE
(2852-2505 calBCE). These burial mounds belong to the southern
expression of the Adriatic-Ljubljana culture (related to later [Cetina
culture](Cetina_culture "wikilink")) which moved southwards along the
Adriatic from the northern Balkans. The same community built similar
mounds in Montenegro (Rakia Kue) and northern Albania (Shtoj).[^19]
The first archaeogenetic find related to the IE-ization of Albania
involves a man with predominantly [Yamnaya
ancestry](Western_Steppe_Herders "wikilink") buried in a tumulus of
northeastern Albania which dates to 2663--2472 calBCE.[^20] During the
Middle Bronze Age, Cetina culture sites and finds appear in Albania.
Cetina culture moved southwards across the Adriatic from the [Cetina
valley](Cetina "wikilink") of [Dalmatia](Dalmatia "wikilink"). In
Albania, Cetina finds are concentrated around southern [Lake
Shkodr](Lake_Shkodr "wikilink") and appear typically in tumulus
cemeteries like in Shkrel and Shtoj and hillforts like Gajtan (Shkodr)
as well as cave sites like Blaz, Nezir and Keputa (central Albania) and
lake basin sites like Sovjan (southeastern Albania).[^21]

### Antiquity

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|History of Albania#Antiquity|l1=Antiquity in Albania}}
```
![Founded in the 4th century BC, the city of [Scodra](Scodra "wikilink")
was the capital of the [Illyrian kingdom](Illyrian_kingdom "wikilink")
of [Ardiaei](Ardiaei "wikilink") and
[Labeatae](Labeatae "wikilink").](The_City_and_the_Prokletije_from_the_castle.jpg "Founded in the 4th century BC, the city of Scodra was the capital of the Illyrian kingdom of Ardiaei and Labeatae.")

The incorporated territory of Albania was historically inhabited by
[Indo-European peoples](Indo-European_people "wikilink"), amongst them
numerous [Illyrian](Illyrian_tribes "wikilink") and
[Epirote](Epirus_(ancient_state) "wikilink") tribes. There were also
several [Greek colonies](Greek_colonization "wikilink"). The territory
referred to as [Illyria](Illyria "wikilink") corresponded roughly to the
area east of the [Adriatic Sea](Adriatic_Sea "wikilink") in the
[Mediterranean Sea](Mediterranean_Sea "wikilink") extending in the south
to the mouth of the [Vjos](Vjos "wikilink").[^22][^23] The first
account of the Illyrian groups comes from [Periplus of the Euxine
Sea](Periplus_of_the_Euxine_Sea "wikilink"), a Greek text written in the
4th century BC.[^24] The [Bryges](Bryges "wikilink") were also present
in central Albania, while the south was inhabited by the Epirote
[Chaonians](Chaonians "wikilink"), whose capital was at
[Phoenice](Phoenice "wikilink").[^25][^26][^27] Other colonies such as
[Apollonia](Apollonia_(Illyria) "wikilink") and
[Epidamnos](Epidamnos "wikilink") were established by Greek city-states
on the coast by the 7th century BC.[^28][^29][^30]

![[Apollonia](Apollonia_(Illyria) "wikilink") was an important [Greek
colony](Colonies_in_antiquity#Greek_colonies "wikilink") on the
[Illyrian](Illyria "wikilink") coast along the [Adriatic
Sea](Adriatic_Sea "wikilink") and one of the western points of the [Via
Egnatia](Via_Egnatia "wikilink") route, that connected Rome and
[Constantinople](Constantinople "wikilink").](Parku_Arkeologjik_i_Apollonis_04.jpg "Apollonia was an important Greek colony on the Illyrian coast along the Adriatic Sea and one of the western points of the Via Egnatia route, that connected Rome and Constantinople.")

The Illyrian [Taulanti](Taulantii "wikilink") were a powerful Illyrian
tribe that were among the earliest recorded tribes in the area. They
lived in a area that corresponds much of present-day Albania. Together
with the Dardanian ruler
[Cleitus](Cleitus_(son_of_Bardylis) "wikilink"),
[Glaucias](Glaucias_of_Taulantii "wikilink"), the ruler of the
Taulantian kingdom, fought against [Alexander the
Great](Alexander_the_Great "wikilink") at the [Battle of
Pelium](Siege_of_Pelium "wikilink") in 335 BC. As the time passed, the
ruler of Ancient Macedonia, [Cassander of Macedon](Cassander "wikilink")
captured Apollonia and crossed the river [Genusus](Shkumbin "wikilink")
(`{{Lang-sq|Shkumbin}}`{=mediawiki}) in 314 BC. A few years later
Glaucias laid siege to Apollonia and captured the Greek colony of
[Epidamnos](Epidamnos "wikilink").[^31]

The Illyrian [Ardiaei](Ardiaei "wikilink") tribe, centred in Montenegro,
ruled over most of the territory of northern Albania. Their [Ardiaean
Kingdom](Ardiaean_Kingdom "wikilink") reached its greatest extent under
[King Agron](Agron_of_Illyria "wikilink"), the son of [Pleuratus
II](Pleuratus_II "wikilink"). Agron extended his rule over other
neighbouring tribes as well.[^32] Following Agron\'s death in 230 BC,
his wife, [Teuta](Teuta "wikilink"), inherited the Ardiaean kingdom.
Teuta\'s forces extended their operations further southwards to
the Ionian Sea.[^33] In 229 BC, Rome declared war[^34] on the kingdom
for extensively plundering Roman ships. The war ended in Illyrian defeat
in 227 BC. Teuta was eventually succeeded
by [Gentius](Gentius "wikilink") in 181 BC.[^35] Gentius clashed with
the Romans in 168 BC, initiating the [Third Illyrian
War](Third_Illyrian_War "wikilink"). The conflict resulted in Roman
conquest of the region by 167 BC. The Romans split the region into three
administrative divisions.[^36]

### Middle Ages {#middle_ages}

![The town of [Kruj](Kruj "wikilink") was the capital of the
[Principality of Arbanon](Principality_of_Arbanon "wikilink") in the
Middle
Ages.](Kruj-KrujaAlbania_2016.jpg "The town of Kruj was the capital of the Principality of Arbanon in the Middle Ages.")

The [Roman Empire](Roman_Empire "wikilink") was split in 395 upon the
death of [Theodosius I](Theodosius_I "wikilink") into an
[Eastern](Eastern_Roman_Empire "wikilink") and [Western Roman
Empire](Western_Roman_Empire "wikilink") in part because of the
increasing pressure from threats during the [Barbarian
Invasions](Barbarian_Invasions "wikilink"). From the 6th century into
the 7th century, the [Slavs](South_Slavs "wikilink") crossed the
[Danube](Danube "wikilink") and largely absorbed the indigenous Greeks,
Illyrians and Thracians in the [Balkans](Balkans "wikilink"); thus, the
Illyrians were mentioned for the last time in historical records in the
7th century.[^37][^38]

In the 11th century, the [Great Schism](Great_Schism_of_1054 "wikilink")
formalised the break of communion between the [Eastern
Orthodox](Eastern_Orthodox_Church "wikilink") and [Western Catholic
Church](Western_Catholic_Church "wikilink") that is reflected in Albania
through the emergence of a Catholic north and Orthodox south. The
Albanian people inhabited the west of [Lake
Ochrida](Lake_Ochrida "wikilink") and the upper valley of [River
Shkumbin](Shkumbin "wikilink") and established the [Principality of
Arbanon](Principality_of_Arbanon "wikilink") in 1190 under the
leadership of [Progon of Kruja](Progon_of_Kruja "wikilink").[^39] The
realm was succeeded by his sons [Gjin](Gjin_Progoni "wikilink") and
Dhimitri.

Upon the death of Dhimiter, the territory came under the rule of the
Albanian-Greek [Gregory Kamonas](Gregory_Kamonas "wikilink") and
subsequently under the [Golem of
Kruja](Golem_of_Kruja "wikilink").[^40][^41][^42] In the 13th century,
the principality was dissolved.[^43][^44][^45] Arbanon is considered to
be the first sketch of an Albanian state, that retained a
[semi-autonomous](semi-autonomous "wikilink") status as the western
extremity of the [Byzantine Empire](Byzantine_Empire "wikilink"), under
the Byzantine [Doukai](Doukas "wikilink") of
[Epirus](Despotate_of_Epirus "wikilink") or
[Laskarids](Laskaris "wikilink") of
[Nicaea](Empire_of_Nicaea "wikilink").[^46]

It illustrates Sultan Mehmet II laying siege to the Albanian town of Scutari, then part of Venetian Empire.")

Towards the end of the 12th and beginning of the 13th centuries,
[Serbs](Kingdom_of_Serbia_(medieval) "wikilink") and
[Venetians](Venetian_Empire "wikilink") started to take possession over
the territory.[^47] The [ethnogenesis](ethnogenesis "wikilink") of the
Albanians is uncertain; however, the first undisputed mention of
Albanians dates back in historical records from 1079 or 1080 in a work
by [Michael Attaliates](Michael_Attaliates "wikilink"), who referred to
the [Albanoi](Albanoi "wikilink") as having taken part in a revolt
against [Constantinople](Constantinople "wikilink").[^48] At this point
the Albanians were fully Christianised.

After the dissolution of Arbanon, [Charles of
Anjou](Charles_I_of_Naples "wikilink") concluded an agreement with the
Albanian rulers, promising to protect them and their ancient liberties.
In 1272, he established the [Kingdom of
Albania](Kingdom_of_Albania_(medieval) "wikilink") and conquered regions
back from the [Despotate of Epirus](Despotate_of_Epirus "wikilink"). The
kingdom claimed all of central Albania territory from
[Dyrrhachium](Dyrrhachium "wikilink") along the Adriatic Sea coast down
to [Butrint](Butrint "wikilink"). A catholic political structure was a
basis for the papal plans of spreading
[Catholicism](Catholicism "wikilink") in the Balkan Peninsula. This plan
found also the support of [Helen of Anjou](Helen_of_Anjou "wikilink"), a
cousin of Charles of Anjou. Around 30 Catholic churches and monasteries
were built during her rule mainly in northern Albania.[^49] Internal
power struggles within the Byzantine Empire in the 14th century enabled
Serbs\' most powerful medieval ruler, [Stefan
Dusan](Stefan_Dusan "wikilink"), to establish a [short-lived
empire](Serbian_Empire "wikilink") that included all of Albania except
Durrs.[^50] In 1367, various Albanian rulers established the [Despotate
of Arta](Despotate_of_Arta "wikilink"). During that time, several
[Albanian principalities](Albanian_principalities "wikilink") were
created, notably the [Principality of
Albania](Principality_of_Albania_(medieval) "wikilink"), [Principality
of Kastrioti](Principality_of_Kastrioti "wikilink"), [Lordship of
Berat](Lordship_of_Berat "wikilink") and [Principality of
Dukagjini](Principality_of_Dukagjini "wikilink"). In the first half of
the 15th century, the [Ottoman Empire](Ottoman_Empire "wikilink")
invaded most of Albania, and the [League of
Lezh](League_of_Lezh "wikilink") was held under
[Skanderbeg](Skanderbeg "wikilink") as a ruler, who became the national
hero of the Albanian medieval history.

```
With the [fall of Constantinople](fall_of_Constantinople "wikilink"),
the Ottoman Empire continued an extended period of conquest and
expansion with its borders going deep into [Southeast
Europe](Ottoman_conquest_of_the_Balkans "wikilink"). They reached the
[Albanian Ionian Sea Coast](Albanian_Ionian_Sea_Coast "wikilink") in
1385 and erected their garrisons across [Southern
Albania](Southern_Albania "wikilink") in 1415 and then occupied most of
Albania in 1431.[^51][^52] Thousands of Albanians consequently fled to
Western Europe, particularly to [Calabria](Calabria "wikilink"),
[Naples](Kingdom_of_Naples "wikilink"),
[Ragusa](Republic_of_Ragusa "wikilink") and
[Sicily](Kingdom_of_Sicily "wikilink"), whereby others sought protection
at the often inaccessible [Mountains of
Albania](Geography_of_Albania "wikilink").[^53][^54] The Albanians, as
Christians, were considered an [inferior class](Rayah "wikilink") of
people, and as such they were subjected to heavy
[taxes](Jizya "wikilink") among others by the
[Devshirme](Devshirme "wikilink") system that allowed the
[Sultan](Sultan "wikilink") to collect a requisite percentage of
Christian adolescents from their families to compose the
[Janissary](Janissary "wikilink").[^55] The Ottoman conquest was also
accompanied with the gradual process of
[Islamisation](Islamisation "wikilink") and the rapid construction of
mosques.

A prosperous and longstanding revolution erupted after the formation of
the [Assembly of Lezh](League_of_Lezh "wikilink") until the [Siege of
Shkodr](Siege_of_Shkodra "wikilink") under the leadership of [Gjergj
Kastrioti Skanderbeg](Gjergj_Kastrioti_Skanderbeg "wikilink"), multiple
times defeating major Ottoman armies led by [Sultans](Sultan "wikilink")
[Murad II](Murad_II "wikilink") and [Mehmed II](Mehmed_II "wikilink").
Skanderbeg managed to gather several of the Albanian principals, amongst
them the [Arianitis](Arianiti_family "wikilink"),
[Dukagjinis](Dukagjini_family "wikilink"),
[Zaharias](Zaharia_family "wikilink") and
[Thopias](Thopia_family "wikilink"), and establish a centralised
authority over most of the non-conquered territories, becoming the [Lord
of Albania](Skanderbeg "wikilink").[^56] Skanderbeg consistently pursued
the goal relentlessly but rather unsuccessfully to constitute a European
coalition against the Ottomans. He thwarted every attempt by the
Ottomans to regain Albania, which they envisioned as a springboard for
the invasion of Western Europe. His unequal fight against them won
financial and military aid from the [Papacy](Papacy "wikilink") and
[Naples](Kingdom_of_Naples "wikilink"),
[Venice](Republic_of_Venice "wikilink") and
[Ragusa](Republic_of_Ragusa "wikilink").[^57]

When the Ottomans were gaining a firm foothold in the region, Albanian
towns were organised into four principal [sanjaks](sanjaks "wikilink").
The government fostered trade by settling a sizeable Jewish colony of
refugees fleeing persecution in Spain. The city of
[Vlor](Vlor "wikilink") saw passing through its ports imported
merchandise from Europe such as velvets, cotton goods, mohairs, carpets,
spices and leather from [Bursa](Bursa "wikilink") and
[Constantinople](Constantinople "wikilink"). Some citizens of Vlor even
had business associates throughout Europe.[^58]

The phenomenon of Islamisation among the Albanians became primarily
widespread from the 17th century and continued into the 18th
century.[^59] Islam offered them equal opportunities and advancement
within the Ottoman Empire. However, motives for conversion were,
according to some scholars, diverse depending on the context though the
lack of source material does not help when investigating such
issues.[^60] Because of increasing suppression of Catholicism, most
Catholic Albanians converted in the 17th century, while Orthodox
Albanians followed suit mainly in the following century.

Since the Albanians were seen as strategically important, they made up a
significant proportion of the [Ottoman
military](Ottoman_military "wikilink") and bureaucracy. Many Muslim
Albanians attained important political and military positions and
culturally contributed to the broader [Muslim
world](Muslim_world "wikilink").[^61] Enjoying this privileged position,
they held various high administrative positions with over two dozen
Albanian [Grand Viziers](Grand_Viziers "wikilink"). Others included
members of the prominent [Kprl family](Kprl_family "wikilink"),
[Zagan Pasha](Zagan_Pasha "wikilink"), [Muhammad Ali of
Egypt](Muhammad_Ali_of_Egypt "wikilink") and [Ali Pasha of
Tepelena](Ali_Pasha_of_Tepelena "wikilink"). Furthermore, two sultans,
[Bayezid II](Bayezid_II "wikilink") and [Mehmed
III](Mehmed_III "wikilink"), both had mothers of Albanian
origin.[^62][^63][^64]

```
The [Albanian Renaissance](Albanian_Renaissance "wikilink") was a period
with its roots in the late 18th century and continuing into the 19th
century, during which the Albanian people gathered spiritual and
intellectual strength for an independent cultural and political life
within an [independent nation](Independent_Albania "wikilink"). Modern
[Albanian culture](Albanian_culture "wikilink") flourished too,
especially [Albanian literature](Albanian_literature "wikilink") and
[arts](Albanian_art "wikilink"), and was frequently linked to the
influences of the [Romanticism](Romanticism "wikilink") and
[Enlightenment](Age_of_Enlightenment "wikilink") principles.[^65] Prior
to the [rise of
nationalism](Rise_of_nationalism_in_the_Ottoman_Empire "wikilink"),
Ottoman authorities suppressed any expression of national unity or
conscience by the Albanian people.

The victory of Russia over the Ottoman Empire following the
[Russian-Ottoman Wars](Russian-Ottoman_War "wikilink") resulted the
execution of the [Treaty of San
Stefano](Treaty_of_San_Stefano "wikilink") which overlooked to assign
Albanian-populated lands to the Slavic and Greek neighbours. However,
the [United
Kingdom](United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland "wikilink") and
[Austro-Hungarian Empire](Austro-Hungarian_Empire "wikilink")
consequently blocked the arrangement and caused the [Treaty of
Berlin](Treaty_of_Berlin_(1878) "wikilink"). From this point, Albanians
started to organise themselves with the goal to protect and unite the
Albanian-populated lands into a unitary nation, leading to the formation
of the [League of Prizren](League_of_Prizren "wikilink"). The league had
initially the assistance of the Ottoman authorities whose position was
based on the religious solidarity of Muslim people and landlords
connected with the [Ottoman administration](Ottoman_Porte "wikilink").
They favoured and protected the Muslim solidarity and called for defence
of Muslim lands simultaneously constituting the reason for titling the
league [Committee of the Real
Muslims](League_of_Prizren#Formation "wikilink").[^66]

Approximately 300 Muslims participated in the assembly composed by
delegates from Bosnia, the [administrator](sanjakbey "wikilink") of the
[Sanjak of Prizren](Sanjak_of_Prizren "wikilink") as representatives of
the central authorities and no delegates from [Vilayet of
Scutari](Vilayet_of_Scutari "wikilink").[^67] Signed by only 47 Muslim
deputies, the league issued the
[Kararname](Kararname_(League_of_Prizren) "wikilink") that contained a
proclamation that the people from northern Albania,
[Epirus](Epirus "wikilink") and [Bosnia and
Herzegovina](Bosnia_and_Herzegovina "wikilink") are willing to defend
the [territorial integrity](territorial_integrity "wikilink") of the
Ottoman Empire by all possible means against the troops of
[Bulgaria](Kingdom_of_Bulgaria "wikilink"),
[Serbia](Kingdom_of_Serbia "wikilink") and
[Montenegro](Kingdom_of_Montenegro "wikilink").[^68]

Ottomans authorities cancelled their assistance when the league, under
[Abdyl Frashri](Abdyl_Frashri "wikilink"), became focused on working
towards Albanian autonomy and requested merging four
[vilayets](Ottoman_vilayet "wikilink"), including
[Kosovo](Kosovo_Vilayet "wikilink"),
[Shkodr](Scutari_Vilayet "wikilink"),
[Monastir](Monastir_Vilayet "wikilink") and
[Ioannina](Janina_Vilayet "wikilink"), into an unified vilayet, the
[Albanian Vilayet](Albanian_Vilayet "wikilink"). The league used
military force to prevent the annexing areas of
[Plav](Plav_Municipality "wikilink") and [Gusinje](Gusinje "wikilink")
assigned to Montenegro. After several successful battles with
Montenegrin troops, such as the [Battle of
Novie](Battle_of_Novie "wikilink"), the league was forced to retreat
from their contested regions. The league was later defeated by the
Ottoman army sent by the sultan.[^69] `{{Clear}}`{=mediawiki}

Albania [declared
independence](Albanian_Declaration_of_Independence "wikilink") from the
Ottoman Empire on 28 November 1912, accompanied with the establishment
of the [Senate](Senate_of_Albania "wikilink") and
[Government](Provisional_Government_of_Albania "wikilink") by the
[Assembly of Vlor](Assembly_of_Vlor "wikilink") on 4 December
1912.[^70][^71][^72][^73] Its sovereignty was recognised by the
[Conference of London](London_Conference_of_19121913 "wikilink"). On 29
July 1913, the [Treaty of London](Treaty_of_London_(1913) "wikilink")
delineated the borders of the country and its neighbours, leaving many
Albanians outside Albania, predominantly
[partitioned](Partition_(politics) "wikilink") between
[Montenegro](Kingdom_of_Montenegro "wikilink"),
[Serbia](Kingdom_of_Serbia "wikilink") and
[Greece](Kingdom_of_Greece "wikilink").[^74]

Headquartered in Vlor, the [International Commission of
Control](International_Commission_of_Control "wikilink") was established
on 15 October 1913 to take care of the administration of newly
established Albania, until its own political institutions were in
order.[^75][^76] The [International
Gendarmerie](International_Gendarmerie "wikilink") was established as
the first law enforcement agency of the [Principality of
Albania](Principality_of_Albania "wikilink"). In November, the first
gendarmerie members arrived in the country. Prince of Albania [Wilhelm
of Wied](Wilhelm_of_Wied "wikilink") *(Princ Vilhelm Vidi)* was selected
as the first prince of the principality.[^77] On 7 March, he arrived in
the provisional capital of [Durrs](Durrs "wikilink") and started to
organise his government, appointing [Turhan Pasha
Prmeti](Turhan_Pasha_Prmeti "wikilink") to form the first Albanian
cabinet.

In November 1913, the Albanian pro-Ottoman forces had offered the throne
of Albania to the Ottoman war Minister of Albanian origin, [Ahmed Izzet
Pasha](Ahmed_Izzet_Pasha "wikilink").[^78] The pro-Ottoman peasants
believed that the new regime was a tool of the six Christian [Great
Powers](Great_Power "wikilink") and local landowners, that owned half of
the arable land.[^79]

In February 1914, the [Autonomous Republic of Northern
Epirus](Autonomous_Republic_of_Northern_Epirus "wikilink") was
proclaimed in [Gjirokastr](Gjirokastr "wikilink") by the local [Greek
population](Greeks_in_Albania "wikilink") against incorporation to
Albania. This initiative was short-lived, and in 1921 the southern
provinces were incorporated into the Albanian Principality.[^80][^81]
Meanwhile, the [revolt of Albanian
peasants](Peasant_Revolt_in_Albania "wikilink") against the new Albanian
regime erupted under the leadership of the group of Muslim clerics
gathered around [Essad Pasha Toptani](Essad_Pasha_Toptani "wikilink"),
who proclaimed himself the saviour of Albania and Islam.[^82][^83] In
order to gain support of the [Mirdita](Mirdita "wikilink") Catholic
volunteers from the northern part of Albania, Prince
[Wied](Wilhelm_of_Wied "wikilink") appointed their leader, [Prnk Bib
Doda](Prnk_Bib_Doda "wikilink"), to be the foreign minister of the
Principality of Albania. In May and June 1914, the International
Gendarmerie was joined by [Isa Boletini](Isa_Boletini "wikilink") and
his men, mostly from [Kosovo](Kosovo "wikilink"),[^84] and northern
[Mirdita](Mirdita "wikilink") Catholics, were defeated by the rebels who
captured most of Central Albania by the end of August 1914.[^85] The
regime of Prince Wied collapsed, and he left the country on 3 September
1914.[^86]

interventions.[^87]`{{cite book |editor1-last=Zickel |editor1-first=Raymond |editor2-last=Iwaskiw |editor2-first=Walter R. |title=Albania country study |publisher=[[Federal Research Division]], [[Library of Congress]] |url=https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/master/frd/frdcstdy/al/albaniacountryst00zick/albaniacountryst00zick.pdf |access-date=11 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230911125032/https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/master/frd/frdcstdy/al/albaniacountryst00zick/albaniacountryst00zick.pdf |archive-date=11 September 2023 |url-status=live}}`{=mediawiki}

[^88] After [World War I](World_War_I "wikilink"), Albania lacked an
established government and internationally recognised borders, rendering
it vulnerable to neighboring entities such as Greece, Italy and
Yugoslavia, all of which sought to expand their influence.[^89] This led
to political uncertainty, highlighted in 1918 when the [Congress of
Durrs](Congress_of_Durrs "wikilink") sought [Paris Peace
Conference](Paris_Peace_Conference_(19191920) "wikilink") protection
but was denied, further complicating Albania\'s position on the
international stage. Territorial tensions escalated as Yugoslavia,
particularly Serbia, sought control of northern Albania, while Greece
aimed dominance in southern Albania. The situation deteriorated in 1919
when the Serbs launched attacks on Albanian inhabitants, among others in
[Gusinje](Gusinje "wikilink") and [Plav](Plav,_Montenegro "wikilink"),
resulting in [massacres and large-scale
displacement](PlavGusinje_massacres_(19121913) "wikilink").[^90][^91][^92]
Meanwhile, Italian influence continued to expand during this time driven
by economic interests and political ambitions.[^93][^94]

[Fan Noli](Fan_Noli "wikilink"), renowned for his
[idealism](idealism "wikilink"), assumed the role of Prime Minister in
the year of 1924, with a vision to institute a Western-style
constitutional government, abolish feudalism, counter Italian influence
and enhance critical sectors including infrastructure, education and
healthcare.[^95] He faced resistance from former allies, who had
assisted in the removal of [Zog](Zog_I_of_Albania "wikilink") from
power, and struggled to secure the foreign aid to implement his agenda.
Noli\'s decision to establish diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union, an
adversary of the Serbian elite, ignited allegations of
[bolshevism](bolshevism "wikilink") from Belgrade.[^96] This, in turn,
led to increased pressure from Italy and culminated in Zog\'s
restoration to authority. Subsequently in 1928, Zogu transitioned
Albania from a republic to a monarchy that garnered backing from
[Fascist Italy](Fascist_Italy_(19221943) "wikilink"), with Zog assuming
the title of King Zog I. Key constitutional changes dissolved the Senate
and established a unicameral National Assembly, while preserving Zog\'s
authoritative powers.[^97]

In 1939, Italy led by [Benito Mussolini](Benito_Mussolini "wikilink"),
launched a military invasion of Albania, resulting to the exile of Zog
and the creation of an [Italian
protectorate](Italian_protectorate_of_Albania_(19391943) "wikilink").[^98][^99]
As [World War II](World_War_II "wikilink") progressed, Italy aimed to
expand its territorial dominion in the Balkans, including territorial
claims on regions of Greece ([Chameria](Chameria "wikilink")),
Macedonia, Montenegro and Kosovo. These ambitions laid the foundation of
[Greater
Albania](Italian_protectorate_of_Albania_(19391943) "wikilink"), which
aimed to unite all areas with Albanian-majority populations into a
single country.[^100] In 1943, as Italy\'s control declined, [Nazi
Germany](Nazi_Germany "wikilink") assumed control of Albania, subjecting
Albanians to forced labor, economic exploitation and repression under
[German rule](German_occupation_of_Albania "wikilink").[^101] The tide
shifted in 1944 when the Albanian partisan forces, under the leadership
of [Enver Hoxha](Enver_Hoxha "wikilink") and other communist leaders,
successfully liberated Albania from German occupation.[^102]

[authoritarian](Authoritarianism "wikilink") policies, including the
prohibition of religious practices, severe restrictions on travel and
the abolition of private property rights.[^104] It was also defined by a
persistent pattern of purges, extensive repression, instances of
betrayal and a hostility towards external influences.[^105] Any form of
opposition or resistance to his rule was met with expeditious and severe
consequences, such as internal exile, extended imprisonment and
execution.[^106] The regime confronted a multitude of challenges in
Albania that encompassed widespread [poverty](poverty "wikilink"),
[illiteracy](Literacy "wikilink"), [health
crises](Health_crisis "wikilink") and [gender
inequality](gender_inequality "wikilink").[^107] As a response, Hoxha
initiated a modernisation initiative aimed at attaining economic and
social liberation and transforming the country into an industrial
society.[^108] The regime placed a high priority on the diversification
of the economy through a programme of Soviet-style industrialisation,
comprehensive infrastructure development such as the introduction of a
transformative [railway system](Hekurudha_Shqiptare "wikilink"),
expansion of education and healthcare services, elimination of adult
illiteracy and targeted advancements in areas such as women\'s
rights.[^109][^110][^111][^112]

![[Bunkers in Albania](Bunkers_in_Albania "wikilink") were constructed
to prevent potential external invasions. By 1983, approximately 173,371
bunkers were scattered throughout its
territory.[^113]](Bunker_in_Albanian_Alps.jpg "Bunkers in Albania were constructed to prevent potential external invasions. By 1983, approximately 173,371 bunkers were scattered throughout its territory.")

The diplomatic history of Albania during the communism was characterised
by notable diplomatic conflicts.[^115] Initially aligned with Yugoslavia
as a satellite state, the relationship deteriorated as Yugoslavia aimed
to incorporate Albania within its territory.[^116] Subsequently, Albania
established relations with the Soviet Union and engaged trade agreements
with other Eastern European countries, but experienced disagreements
over Soviet policies, leading to strained ties with Moscow and a
diplomatic separation in 1961.[^117] Simultaneously, tensions with the
West also heightened due to Albania\'s refusal to hold free elections
and allegations of Western support for [Anti-Communist
uprisings](Anti-communism "wikilink"). Albania\'s enduring partnership
was with China as it sided with Beijing during the [Sino-Soviet
conflict](Sino-Soviet_split "wikilink"), resulting in severed ties with
the Soviet Union and withdrawal from the [Warsaw
Pact](Warsaw_Pact "wikilink") in response to the invasion of
Czechoslovakia in 1968. However, their relations stagnated in the 1970,
prompting both sides to reassess their commitment, and Albania actively
reduced its dependence on China.[^118]

Under Hoxha\'s regime, Albania underwent a widespread campaign targeting
religious clergy of various faiths, resulting in public persecution and
executions, particularly targeting Muslims, Roman Catholics and Eastern
Orthodox adherents.[^119] In 1946, religious estates underwent
nationalisation, coinciding with the closure or transformation of
religious institutions into various other purposes.[^120] The
culmination occurred in 1976 when Albania attained the status of being
the world\'s first constitutional atheist state.[^121] Under this
regime, Albanians were forced to renounce their religious beliefs, adopt
a secular way of life and embrace a socialist ideology.[^122][^123]

[Tirana](Tirana "wikilink").](Tirana_Square_1988.jpg "In 1988, the first foreigners were allowed to walk into the car-free Skanderbeg Square in Tirana.")

After four decades of communism paired with the [revolutions of
1989](revolutions_of_1989 "wikilink"), Albania witnessed a notable rise
in political activism, particularly among the students, which ultimately
lead to a transformation in the prevailing order. Subsequent to the
attainment of widespread in the first [multi-party
elections](multi-party_elections "wikilink") of
[1991](Albanian_parliamentary_election,_1991 "wikilink"), the communist
party maintained a stronghold in the parliament until their defeat in
the [parliamentary elections of
1992](Albanian_parliamentary_election,_1992 "wikilink") directed by the
[Democratic Party](Democratic_Party_of_Albania "wikilink").[^124]
Considerable economic and financial resources were devoted to [pyramid
schemes](Pyramid_schemes_in_Albania "wikilink") that were widely
supported by the government. The schemes swept up somewhere between one
sixth and one third of the population of the country.[^125][^126]
Despite the warnings of the [International Monetary
Fund](International_Monetary_Fund "wikilink"), [Sali
Berisha](Sali_Berisha "wikilink") defended the schemes as large
investment firms, leading more people to redirect their remittances and
sell their homes and cattle for cash to deposit in the schemes.[^127]

The schemes began to collapse in late 1996, leading many of the
investors to join initially peaceful protests against the government,
requesting their money back. The protests turned violent in February
1997 as government forces responded by firing on the demonstrators. In
March, the Police and Republican Guard deserted, leaving their armouries
open. These were promptly emptied by militias and criminal gangs. The
resulting [civil war](Albanian_Civil_War "wikilink") caused a wave of
evacuations of foreign nationals and refugees.[^128]

The crisis led both [Aleksandr Meksi](Aleksandr_Meksi "wikilink") and
[Sali Berisha](Sali_Berisha "wikilink") to resign from office in the
wake of the general election. In April 1997, [Operation
Alba](Operation_Alba "wikilink"), a UN peacekeeping force led by Italy,
entered the country with two goals exclusively to assist with the
evacuation of expatriates and to secure the ground for international
organisations. The main international organisation that was involved was
the [Western European Union](Western_European_Union "wikilink")\'s
[multinational](Albanian_civil_war_of_1997#International_intervention "wikilink")
[Albanian Police](Albanian_Police "wikilink") element, which worked with
the government to restructure the [judicial
system](Judicial_system_of_Albania "wikilink") and simultaneously the
Albanian police. `{{Clear}}`{=mediawiki}

Following the disintegration of the [communist
system](Communist_Albania "wikilink"), Albania embarked on an active
path towards [Westernisation](Westernisation "wikilink") with the
ambition to obtain membership in the [European
Union](European_Union "wikilink") (EU) and the [North Atlantic Treaty
Organization](North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization "wikilink")
(NATO).[^131] A notable milestone was reached in 2009 when the country
attained [membership](AlbaniaNATO_relations "wikilink") in NATO,
marking a pioneering achievement among the nations of [Southeast
Europe](Southeast_Europe "wikilink").[^132][^133] In adherence to its
vision for further integration into the EU, it [formally
applied](Accession_of_Albania_to_the_European_Union "wikilink") for
membership on 28 April 2009.[^134] Another milestone was reached on 24
June 2014, when the country was granted [official candidate
status](Future_enlargement_of_the_European_Union "wikilink").[^135]

[Edi Rama](Edi_Rama "wikilink") of the [Socialist
Party](Socialist_Party_of_Albania "wikilink") won both the
[2013](Albanian_parliamentary_election,_2013 "wikilink") and [2017
parliamentary
elections](Albanian_parliamentary_election,_2017 "wikilink"). As [Prime
Minister](Prime_Minister_of_Albania "wikilink"), he implemented numerous
reforms focused on [modernising](Modernism "wikilink") the
[economy](Economy_of_Albania "wikilink"), as well as democratising state
institutions, including the country\'s
[judiciary](Judiciary_of_Albania "wikilink") and [law
enforcement](Law_enforcement_in_Albania "wikilink"). Unemployment has
been steadily reduced, with Albania achieving the 4th lowest
[unemployment rate](List_of_countries_by_unemployment_rate "wikilink")
in the Balkans.[^136] Rama has also placed [gender
equality](gender_equality "wikilink") at the centre of his agenda; since
2017 almost 50% of the ministers are female, the largest number of women
serving in the country\'s history.[^137] During the [2021 parliamentary
elections](2021_Albanian_parliamentary_election "wikilink"), the ruling
Socialist Party led by Edi Rama secured its third consecutive victory,
winning nearly half of votes and enough seats in parliament to govern
alone.[^138][^139]

On 26 November 2019, a 6.4
[magnitude](Moment_magnitude_scale "wikilink")
[earthquake](earthquake "wikilink") ravaged Albania with the
[epicentre](epicentre "wikilink") positioned approximately
`{{convert|16|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}`{=mediawiki} southwest of the town of
[Mamurras](Mamurras "wikilink").[^140] The tremor was felt in
[Tirana](Tirana "wikilink") and in places as far away as
[Taranto](Taranto "wikilink"), Italy, and
[Belgrade](Belgrade "wikilink"), Serbia, while the most affected areas
were the coastal city of [Durrs](Durrs "wikilink") and the village of
[Kodr-Thuman](Kodr-Thuman "wikilink").[^141] Comprehensive response
to the earthquake included substantial humanitarian aid from the
[Albanian diaspora](Albanian_diaspora "wikilink") and various countries
[around the
world](2019_Albania_earthquake#International_assistance "wikilink").[^142]

On 9 March 2020, [COVID-19](COVID-19_pandemic_in_Albania "wikilink") was
confirmed to have spread to Albania.[^143][^144] From March to June
2020, the government declared a [state of
emergency](state_of_emergency "wikilink") as a measure to limit the
rapid spread of the pandemic in the country.[^145][^146][^147] The
country\'s COVID-19 [vaccination
campaign](COVID-19_vaccination_in_Albania "wikilink") started on 11
January 2021; however, as of 11 August 2021, the total number of
vaccines administered so far in Albania amounts to 1,280,239
doses.[^148][^149]

Alps](Dinaric_Alps "wikilink").](Valbona_nga_Kukaj.jpg "The Albanian Alps are an extension and simultaneously the highest section of the Dinaric Alps."){width="300"}

With an area of `{{convert|28748|km2|0|abbr=on}}`{=mediawiki}, Albania
is situated along the [Mediterranean Sea](Mediterranean_Sea "wikilink")
on the [Balkan Peninsula](Balkan_Peninsula "wikilink") in
[South](Southern_Europe "wikilink") and [Southeast
Europe](Southeast_Europe "wikilink").[^150] The country is bordered by
the [Adriatic Sea](Adriatic_Sea "wikilink") to the west,
[Montenegro](Montenegro "wikilink") to the northwest,
[Kosovo](Kosovo "wikilink") to the northeast, [North
Macedonia](North_Macedonia "wikilink") to the east,
[Greece](Greece "wikilink") to the south and the [Ionian
Sea](Ionian_Sea "wikilink") to the southwest. It is positioned between
latitudes [42](42nd_parallel_north "wikilink") and [39
N](39th_parallel_north "wikilink"), and longitudes
[21](21st_meridian_east "wikilink") and [19
E](19th_meridian_east "wikilink"). Geographic coordinates include
[Vrmosh](Vrmosh "wikilink") at 42 35\' 34\" northern latitude as the
northernmost point, [Konispol](Konispol "wikilink") at 39 40\' 0\"
northern latitude as the southernmost point,
[Sazan](Sazan_Island "wikilink") at 19 16\' 50\" eastern longitude as
the westernmost point and [Vrnik](Vrnik "wikilink") at 21 1\' 26\"
eastern longitude as the easternmost point.[^151] [Mount
Korab](Mount_Korab "wikilink"), rising at
`{{convert|2764|m|ft|2|abbr=on}}`{=mediawiki} [above the
Adriatic](Metres_above_the_Adriatic "wikilink"), is the highest point,
while the Mediterranean Sea, at
`{{convert|0|m|ft|2|abbr=on}}`{=mediawiki}, is the lowest point. The
country extends `{{convert|148|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}`{=mediawiki} from east
to west and around `{{convert|340|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}`{=mediawiki} from
north to south.

Albania possesses a diverse and varied landscape with mountains and
hills that traverse its territory in various directions. The country is
home to extensive mountain ranges, including the [Albanian
Alps](Albanian_Alps "wikilink") in the north, the [Korab
Mountains](Korab "wikilink") in the east, the [Pindus
Mountains](Pindus_Mountains "wikilink") in the southeast, the [Ceraunian
Mountains](Ceraunian_Mountains "wikilink") in the southwest and the
[Skanderbeg Mountains](Skanderbeg_Mountains "wikilink") in the centre.
In the northwest, the country boasts the remarkable [Lake of
Shkodr](Lake_of_Shkodr "wikilink"), recognised as the largest lake in
Southern Europe.[^152] Towards the
[southeast](Albanian_Ohrid_Lake_Coast "wikilink"), the [Lake of
Ohrid](Lake_of_Ohrid "wikilink") emerges, renowned as one of the
world\'s oldest continuously existing lakes.[^153] Further to the south,
the expanse includes the [Large](Prespa_Lake "wikilink") and [Small Lake
of Prespa](Small_Prespa_Lake "wikilink"), distinguished as some of the
highest positioned lakes in the Balkans. Rivers rise mostly in the east
of Albania and discharge into the Adriatic Sea but as well as into the
Ionian Sea to a lesser extent. The longest river in the country,
measured from its mouth to its source, is the
[Drin](Drin_River "wikilink") that starts at the confluence of its two
headwaters, the [Black](Black_Drin "wikilink") and [White
Drin](White_Drin "wikilink"). Of particular concern is the
[Vjos](Vjos "wikilink"), which represents one of the last intact large
river systems in Europe.

### Climate

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Climate of Albania}}
```
![[Gjipe](Gjipe "wikilink") is located on the confluence of the
[Adriatic](Adriatic_Sea "wikilink") and [Ionian
Sea](Ionian_Sea "wikilink"), on the [Albanian
Riviera](Albanian_Riviera "wikilink").](Gjipe_beach,_Albania.JPG "Gjipe is located on the confluence of the Adriatic and Ionian Sea, on the Albanian Riviera.")

The [climate of Albania](climate_of_Albania "wikilink") exhibits a
distinguished level of variability and diversity due to the differences
in latitude, longitude and altitude.[^154][^155] Albania experiences a
[Mediterranean](Mediterranean_climate "wikilink") and [Continental
climate](Continental_climate "wikilink"), characterised by the presence
of four distinct seasons.[^156] According to the [Kppen
classification](Kppen_climate_classification "wikilink"), Albania
encompasses five primary climatic types, spanning from Mediterranean and
[subtropical](Humid_subtropical_climate "wikilink") in the western half
to [oceanic](Oceanic_climate "wikilink"),
[continental](Humid_continental_climate "wikilink") and
[subarctic](Subarctic_climate "wikilink") in the eastern half of the
country.[^157] The coastal regions along the
[Adriatic](Albanian_Adriatic_Sea_Coast "wikilink") and [Ionian
Seas](Albanian_Ionian_Sea_Coast "wikilink") in Albania are acknowledged
as the warmest areas, while the northern and eastern regions
encompassing the [Albanian Alps](Albanian_Alps "wikilink") and the
[Korab Mountains](Korab_Mountains "wikilink") are recognised as the
coldest areas in the country.[^158] Throughout the year, the average
monthly temperatures fluctuate, ranging from
`{{convert|-1|C|F|lk=on}}`{=mediawiki} during the winter months to
`{{convert|21.8|C|F|lk=off}}`{=mediawiki} in the summer months.
Notably, the highest recorded temperature of
`{{convert|43.9|C|F|lk=off}}`{=mediawiki} was observed in
[Kuov](Kuov "wikilink") on 18 July 1973, while the lowest
temperature of `{{convert|-29|C|F|lk=off}}`{=mediawiki} was recorded
in Shtyll, [Librazhd](Librazhd "wikilink") on 9 January
2017.[^159][^160]

Albania receives most of the
[precipitation](precipitation_(meteorology) "wikilink") in winter months
and less in summer months.[^161] The average precipitation is about
`{{convert|1485|mm|in|abbr=off}}`{=mediawiki}.[^162] The mean annual
precipitation ranges between
`{{convert|600|mm|in|abbr=off}}`{=mediawiki} and
`{{convert|3000|mm|in|abbr=off}}`{=mediawiki} depending on geographical
location.[^163] The
[northwestern](Northern_Mountain_Range_(Albania) "wikilink") and
[southeastern highlands](Southern_Mountain_Range_(Albania) "wikilink")
receive the intenser amount of precipitation, whilst the
[northeastern](Northern_Mountain_Range_(Albania) "wikilink") and
[southwestern highlands](Southern_Mountain_Range_(Albania) "wikilink")
as well as the [Western Lowlands](Western_Lowlands "wikilink") the more
limited amount.[^164] The [Albanian Alps](Albanian_Alps "wikilink") in
the far north of the country are considered to be among the most humid
regions of Europe, receiving at least
`{{convert|3100|mm|1|abbr=on}}`{=mediawiki} of rain annually.[^165] Four
[glaciers](glacier "wikilink") within these mountains were discovered at
a relatively low altitude of `{{convert|2000|m|ft}}`{=mediawiki}, which
is extremely rare for such a southerly latitude.[^166]

A [biodiversity hotspot](biodiversity_hotspot "wikilink"), Albania
possesses an exceptionally rich and contrasting
[biodiversity](biodiversity "wikilink") on account of its geographical
location at the centre of the [Mediterranean
Sea](Mediterranean_Sea "wikilink") and the great diversity in its
[climatic](climatic "wikilink"), geological and
[hydrological](hydrological "wikilink") conditions.[^167][^168] Because
of remoteness, the mountains and hills of Albania are endowed with
forests, trees and grasses that are essential to the lives for a wide
variety of animals, among others for two of the most [endangered
species](endangered_species "wikilink") of the country, the
[lynx](Balkan_lynx "wikilink") and [brown bear](brown_bear "wikilink"),
as well as the [wildcat](wildcat "wikilink"), [grey
wolf](grey_wolf "wikilink"), [red fox](red_fox "wikilink"), [golden
jackal](golden_jackal "wikilink"), [Egyptian
vulture](Egyptian_vulture "wikilink") and [golden
eagle](golden_eagle "wikilink"), the latter constituting the national
animal of the country.[^169][^170][^171][^172]

The estuaries, wetlands and lakes are extraordinarily important for the
[greater flamingo](greater_flamingo "wikilink"), [pygmy
cormorant](pygmy_cormorant "wikilink") and the extremely rare and
perhaps the most iconic bird of the country, the [dalmatian
pelican](dalmatian_pelican "wikilink").[^173] Of particular importance
are the [Mediterranean monk seal](Mediterranean_monk_seal "wikilink"),
[loggerhead sea turtle](loggerhead_sea_turtle "wikilink") and [green sea
turtle](green_sea_turtle "wikilink") that use to nest on the country\'s
coastal waters and shores.

In terms of [phytogeography](phytogeography "wikilink"), Albania is part
of the [Boreal Kingdom](Boreal_Kingdom "wikilink") and stretches
specifically within the [Illyrian](Illyria "wikilink") province of the
[Circumboreal](Circumboreal_Region "wikilink") and [Mediterranean
Region](Mediterranean_Basin "wikilink"). Its territory can be subdivided
into four terrestrial [ecoregions](ecoregion "wikilink") of the
[Palearctic realm](Palearctic_realm "wikilink") namely within the
[Illyrian deciduous forests](Illyrian_deciduous_forests "wikilink"),
[Balkan mixed forests](Balkan_mixed_forests "wikilink"), [Pindus
Mountains mixed forests](Pindus_Mountains_mixed_forests "wikilink") and
[Dinaric Mountains mixed
forests](Dinaric_Mountains_mixed_forests "wikilink").[^174][^175]

Approximately 3,500 different species of plants can be found in Albania
which refers principally to a [Mediterranean](Mediterranean "wikilink")
and [Eurasian](Eurasia "wikilink") character. The country maintains a
vibrant tradition of herbal and medicinal practices. At the minimum 300
plants growing locally are used in the preparation of herbs and
medicines.[^176] The trees within the forests are primarily
[fir](fir "wikilink"), [oak](oak "wikilink"), [beech](beech "wikilink")
and [pine](pine "wikilink").

Albania has been an active participant in numerous international
agreements and conventions aimed at strengthing its commitment to the
preservation and sustainable management of biological diversity. Since
1994, the country is a party to the [Convention on Biological
Diversity](Convention_on_Biological_Diversity "wikilink") (CBD) and its
associated [Cartagena](Cartagena_Protocol_on_Biosafety "wikilink") and
[Nagoya Protocols](Nagoya_Protocol "wikilink").[^177] To uphold these
commitments, it has developed and implemented a comprehensive [National
Biodiversity Strategy and Action
Plan](Biodiversity_action_plan "wikilink") (NBSAP).[^178] Furthermore,
Albania has established a partnership with the [International Union for
Conservation of
Nature](International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature "wikilink")
(IUCN), advancing its conservation efforts on both national and
international scales. Guided by the IUCN, the country has made
substantial progress in the foundation of [protected
areas](protected_area "wikilink") within its boundaries, encompassing 12
[national parks](national_park "wikilink") among others
[Butrint](Butrint_National_Park "wikilink"),
[Karaburun-Sazan](Karaburun-Sazan_Marine_Park "wikilink"),
[Llogara](Llogara_National_Park "wikilink"),
[Prespa](Prespa_National_Park_(Albania) "wikilink") and
[Vjosa](Vjosa_Wild_River_National_Park "wikilink").[^179]

As a signatory to the [Ramsar Convention](Ramsar_Convention "wikilink"),
Albania has granted special recognition upon four wetlands, designating
them as Wetlands of International Importance, including
[Buna](Bojana_(river) "wikilink")-[Shkodr](Lake_Skadar "wikilink"),
[Butrint](Butrint_Lagoon "wikilink"),
[Karavasta](Karavasta_Lagoon "wikilink") and
[Prespa](Lake_Prespa "wikilink").[^180] The country\'s dedication to
protection extends further into the sphere of
[UNESCO](UNESCO "wikilink")\'s [World Network of Biosphere
Reserves](World_Network_of_Biosphere_Reserves "wikilink"), operating
within the framework of the [Man and the Biosphere
Programme](Man_and_the_Biosphere_Programme "wikilink"), evidenced by its
engagement in the [Ohrid-Prespa Transboundary Biosphere
Reserve](Ohrid-Prespa_Transboundary_Biosphere_Reserve "wikilink").[^181][^182]
Furthermore, Albania is host to two natural [World Heritage
Sites](World_Heritage_Site "wikilink"), which encompass the Ohrid region
and both the [Gashi River](Gashi_River "wikilink") and
[Rrajca](Rrajce "wikilink") as part of [Ancient and Primeval Beech
Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of
Europe](Ancient_and_Primeval_Beech_Forests_of_the_Carpathians_and_Other_Regions_of_Europe "wikilink").[^183]

### Environmental issues {#environmental_issues}

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Environmental issues in Albania}}
```
Environmental issues in Albania notably encompass
[air](Air_pollution "wikilink") and [water
pollution](water_pollution "wikilink"), [climate
change](Climate_change_in_Albania "wikilink") impacts, [waste
management](waste_management "wikilink") shortcomings, [biodiversity
loss](Conservation_biology "wikilink") and imperative for [nature
conservation](nature_conservation "wikilink").[^186][^187] Climate
change is predicted to exert significant impacts on the quality of life
in Albania.[^188] The country is recognised as [vulnerable to climate
change](Climate_change_vulnerability "wikilink") impacts, ranked 79
among 181 countries in the [Notre Dame Global Adaptation
Index](Notre_Dame_Global_Adaptation_Index "wikilink") of 2020.[^189]
Factors that account for the country\'s vulnerability to climate change
risks include geological and hydrological [hazards](hazard "wikilink"),
including earthquakes, flooding, fires, landslides, torrential rains,
river and coastal erosion.[^190][^191]

As a party to the [Kyoto Protocol](Kyoto_Protocol "wikilink") and the
[Paris Agreement](Paris_Agreement "wikilink"), Albania is committed to
reduce [greenhouse gas emissions](greenhouse_gas_emissions "wikilink")
by 45% and achieve [carbon neutrality](carbon_neutrality "wikilink") by
2050 which, along with national policies, will help to mitigate the
impacts of the climate change.[^192] The country has a moderate and
improving performance in the [Environmental Performance
Index](Environmental_Performance_Index "wikilink") with an overall
ranking of 62 out of 180 countries in 2022.[^193] Albania\'s ranking
has, however, decreased since its highest placement at position 15 in
the Environmental Performance Index of 2012.[^194] In 2019, Albania had
a [Forest Landscape Integrity
Index](Forest_Landscape_Integrity_Index "wikilink") mean score of 6.77
from 10, ranking it 64th globally out of 172 countries.[^195]

Since declaring independence in 1912, Albania has experienced a
significant political transformation, traversing through distinct
periods that included a monarchical rule, a communist regime and the
eventual establishment of a democratic order.[^196] In 1998, Albania
transitioned into a [sovereign](sovereign_state "wikilink")
[parliamentary](parliamentary_republic "wikilink") [constitutional
republic](constitutional_republic "wikilink"), marking a fundamental
milestone in its political evolution.[^197] Its governance structure
operates under a [constitution](Constitution_of_Albania "wikilink") that
serves as the principal document of the country.[^198] The constitution
is grounded in the principle of the [separation of
powers](separation_of_powers "wikilink"), with three arms of government
that encompass the legislative embodied in the
[Parliament](Parliament_of_Albania "wikilink"), the executive led by the
[President](President_of_Albania "wikilink") as the ceremonial [head of
state](head_of_state "wikilink") and the [Prime
Minister](Prime_Minister_of_Albania "wikilink") as the functional [head
of government](head_of_government "wikilink"), and the judiciary with a
hierarchy of courts, including the
[constitutional](Constitutional_Court_of_Albania "wikilink") and
[supreme courts](Supreme_Court_of_Albania "wikilink") as well as
multiple [appeal](Appeals_courts_of_Albania "wikilink") and
[administrative
courts](Administrative_Courts_in_Albania "wikilink").[^199]

Albania\'s legal system is structured to protect the political rights of
its people, regardless of their ethnic, linguistic, racial or religious
affiliations.[^200][^201] Despite these principles, there are
significant human rights concerns in Albania that demand
attention.[^202] These concerns include issues related to the
independence of the judiciary, the absence of a free media sector and
the enduring problem of corruption within various governmental bodies,
law enforcement agencies and other institutions.[^203] However, as
Albania pursues its path towards [European
Union](European_Union "wikilink") (EU) membership, active efforts are
being made to achieve substantial improvements in these areas to align
with EU criteria and standards.[^204]

### Foreign relations {#foreign_relations}

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Foreign relations of Albania}}
```
![Assisted by the governments of [Kosovo](Kosovo "wikilink") and
Albania, an official application for the inclusion of the [Arbresh
people](Arbresh_people "wikilink") in the list of
[UNESCO](UNESCO "wikilink")\'s [Intangible Cultural
Heritage](UNESCO_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_Lists "wikilink") is being
prepared.[^205]](Artigianato_Arberesh.jpg "Assisted by the governments of Kosovo and Albania, an official application for the inclusion of the Arbresh people in the list of UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage is being prepared.")

Emerging from decades of isolation during the communism, Albania has
adopted a [foreign policy](Foreign_relations_of_Albania "wikilink")
orientation centered on active cooperation and engagement in
international affairs. At the core of Albania\'s foreign policies lie a
set of objectives, which encompass the commitment to protect its
sovereignty and territorial integrity, the cultivation of diplomatic
ties with other countries, advocating for [international recognition of
Kosovo](international_recognition_of_Kosovo "wikilink"), addressing the
concerns related to the [expulsion of Cham
Albanians](expulsion_of_Cham_Albanians "wikilink"), pursuing
Euro-Atlantic integration and protecting the rights of the Albanians in
[Kosovo](Albanians_in_Kosovo "wikilink"),
[Greece](Albanians_in_greece "wikilink"),
[Italy](Arbresh_people "wikilink"),
[Montenegro](Albanians_in_Montenegro "wikilink"), [North
Macedonia](Albanians_in_Macedonia "wikilink"),
[Serbia](Albanians_in_south_Serbia "wikilink") and the
[diaspora](Albanian_diaspora "wikilink").[^207]

The external affairs of Albania underscore the country\'s dedication to
regional stability and integration into major international
institutions.[^208] Albania became a member of the [United
Nations](United_Nations "wikilink") (UN) in 1955, shortly after emerging
from a period of isolation during the communist era.[^209] The country
reached a major achievement in its foreign policy by securing membership
in the [North Atlantic Treaty Organization](NATO "wikilink") (NATO) in
2009.[^210][^211] Since obtaining candidate status in 2014, the country
has also embarked on a comprehensive reform agenda to align itself with
European Union (EU) accession standards, with the objective of becoming
an EU member state.[^212]

Albania and Kosovo maintain a fraternal relationship strengthened by
their substantial cultural, ethnical and historical ties.[^213] Both
countries foster enduring diplomatic ties, with Albania actively
supporting Kosovo\'s development and international integration
efforts.[^214] Its fundamental contribution to [Kosovo\'s path to
independence](2008_Kosovo_declaration_of_independence "wikilink") is
underscored by its early [recognition of Kosovo\'s
sovereignty](International_recognition_of_Kosovo "wikilink") in
2008.[^215] Furthermore, both governments hold annual joint meetings,
displayed by the inaugural meeting in 2014, which serves as an official
platform to enhance bilateral cooperation and reinforce their joint
commitment to policies that promote the stability and prosperity of the
broader Albanian region.[^216]

### Military

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Armed Forces of Albania}}
```
![[Albanian soldiers](Albanian_Land_Force "wikilink") in the [Province
of Kandahar](Kandahar_Province "wikilink"),

The [Albanian Armed Forces](Albanian_Armed_Forces "wikilink") consist of
[Land](Albanian_Land_Force "wikilink"),
[Air](Albanian_Air_Force "wikilink") and [Naval
Forces](Albanian_Naval_Force "wikilink") and constitute the military and
paramilitary forces of the country. They are led by a
[commander-in-chief](commander-in-chief "wikilink") under the
supervision of the [Ministry of
Defence](Ministry_of_Defence_(Albania) "wikilink") and by the
[President](President_of_Albania "wikilink") as the supreme commander
during wartime. However, in times of peace its powers are executed
through the [Prime Minister](Prime_Minister_of_Albania "wikilink") and
the [Defence Minister](Ministry_of_Defence_(Albania) "wikilink").[^217]

The chief purpose of the armed forces of Albania is the defence of the
independence, the [sovereignty](sovereignty "wikilink") and the
[territorial integrity](territorial_integrity "wikilink") of the
country, as well as the participation in humanitarian, combat,
non-combat and peace support operations.[^218] [Military
service](Military_service "wikilink") is voluntary since 2010 with the
age of 19 being the legal minimum age for the duty.[^219][^220]

Albania has committed to increase the participations in multinational
operations.[^221] Since the fall of communism, the country has
participated in six international missions but only one United Nations
mission in [Georgia](UNOMIG "wikilink"), where it sent three military
observers. Since February 2008, Albania has participated officially in
NATO\'s [Operation Active
Endeavor](Operation_Active_Endeavor "wikilink") in the [Mediterranean
Sea](Mediterranean_Sea "wikilink").[^222] It was invited to join NATO on
3 April 2008, and it became a full member on 2 April 2009.[^223]

Albania reduced the number of active troops from 65,000 in 1988 to
14,500 in 2009.[^224][^225] The military now consists mainly of a small
fleet of aircraft and sea vessels. Increasing the military budget was
one of the most important conditions for [NATO](NATO "wikilink")
integration. As of 1996 military spending was an estimated 1.5% of the
country\'s GDP, only to peak in 2009 at 2% and fall again to 1.5%.[^226]

### Administrative divisions {#administrative_divisions}

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Albania}}
```
```{=mediawiki}
{{See also|Counties of Albania|Regions of Albania|Municipalities of Albania|Communes of Albania|List of cities and towns in Albania|Villages of Albania}}
```
Albania is defined within a territorial area of
`{{convert|28748|km2|0|abbr=on}}`{=mediawiki} in the [Balkan
Peninsula](Balkan_Peninsula "wikilink"). It is informally divided into
three regions, the [Northern](Northern_Albania "wikilink"),
[Central](Central_Albania "wikilink") and [Southern
Regions](Southern_Albania "wikilink"). Since [its Declaration of
Independence](Albanian_Declaration_of_Independence "wikilink") in 1912,
Albania has reformed [its internal
organization](Administrative_divisions_of_Albania#History "wikilink") 21
times. Presently, the primary [administrative
units](administrative_divisions_of_Albania "wikilink") are the twelve
constituent [counties](counties_of_Albania "wikilink")
(`{{lang|sq|{{linktext|qarqe|lang=sq}}/{{linktext|qarqet|lang=sq}}}}`{=mediawiki}),
which hold equal status under the law.[^227] Counties had previously
been used in the 1950s and were recreated on 31 July 2000 to unify the
36 [districts](Districts_of_Albania "wikilink")
(`{{lang|sq|{{linktext|rrath|lang=sq}}/{{linktext|rratht|lang=sq}}}}`{=mediawiki})
of that time.[^228][^229] The largest county in Albania by population is
[Tirana County](Tirana_County "wikilink") with over 800,000 people. The
smallest county, by population, is [Gjirokastr
County](Gjirokastr_County "wikilink") with over 70,000 people. The
largest in the county, by area, is [Kor
County](Kor_County "wikilink") encompassing
`{{convert|3711|km|sqmi}}`{=mediawiki} of the southeast of Albania. The
smallest county, by area, is [Durrs County](Durrs_County "wikilink")
with an area of `{{convert|766|km|sqmi}}`{=mediawiki} in the west of
Albania.

The counties are made up of 61 second-level divisions known as
[municipalities](municipalities_of_Albania "wikilink")
(`{{lang|sq|{{linktext|bashki|lang=sq}}/{{linktext|bashkia|lang=sq}}}}`{=mediawiki}).[^230]
The municipalities are the first level of local governance, responsible
for local needs and [law
enforcement](Law_enforcement_in_Albania "wikilink").[^231][^232][^233]
They unified and simplified the previous system of
[urban](urban_municipalities_of_Albania "wikilink") and [rural
municipalities](rural_municipalities_of_Albania "wikilink") or
[communes](Communes_of_Albania "wikilink")
(`{{lang|sq|{{linktext|komuna|lang=sq}}/{{linktext|komunat|lang=sq}}}}`{=mediawiki})
in 2015.[^234][^235] For smaller issues of [local
government](local_government "wikilink"), the municipalities are
organized into 373 [administrative
units](administrative_units_of_Albania "wikilink")
(`{{lang|sq|njsia}}`{=mediawiki}/`{{lang|sq|njsit administrative}}`{=mediawiki}).
There are also 2980 villages
(`{{lang|sq|{{linktext|fshatra|lang=sq}}/{{linktext|fshatrat|lang=sq}}}}`{=mediawiki}),
neighborhoods or wards
(`{{lang|sq|{{linktext|lagje|lang=sq}}/{{linktext|lagjet|lang=sq}}}}`{=mediawiki}),
and localities
(`{{lang|sq|{{linktext|lokalitete|lang=sq}}/{{linktext|lokalitetet|lang=sq}}}}`{=mediawiki})
previously used as administrative units.

```
```{=mediawiki}
{{update section|date=May 2023}}
```
![[Tirana](Tirana "wikilink") is the economic hub of the country. It is
home to major domestic and foreign companies operating in the
country.](Toptani_Shopping_Mall_Tirana_2016.jpg "Tirana is the economic hub of the country. It is home to major domestic and foreign companies operating in the country.")

The transition from a socialist [planned
economy](planned_economy "wikilink") to a capitalist [mixed
economy](mixed_economy "wikilink") in Albania has been largely
successful.[^240] The country has a
[developing](Developing_country "wikilink") mixed economy classified by
the [World Bank](World_Bank "wikilink") as an [upper-middle income
economy](List_of_countries_by_GNI_(nominal,_Atlas_method)_per_capita#Upper-middle-income_group "wikilink").
In 2016, it had the fourth lowest [unemployment
rate](List_of_countries_by_unemployment_rate "wikilink") in the
[Balkans](Balkans "wikilink") with an estimated value of 14.7%. Its
largest trading partners are Italy, Greece, China, Spain, Kosovo and the
United States. The [lek](Albanian_lek "wikilink") (ALL) is the
country\'s currency and is [pegged](Fixed_exchange_rate "wikilink") at
approximately 132.51 lek per euro.

The cities of [Tirana](Tirana "wikilink") and
[Durrs](Durrs "wikilink") constitute the economic and financial heart
of Albania due to their high population, modern infrastructure and
strategic geographical location. The country\'s most important
infrastructure facilities take course through both of the cities,
connecting the north to the south as well as the west to the east. Among
the largest [companies](List_of_companies_of_Albania "wikilink") are the
petroleum [Tai Oil](Tai_Oil "wikilink"),
[Albpetrol](Albpetrol "wikilink"), [ARMO](ARMO_oil_refiner "wikilink")
and Kastrati, the mineral [AlbChrome](AlbChrome "wikilink"), the cement
[Antea](Antea_Cement "wikilink"), the investment [BALFIN
Group](Samir_Mane "wikilink") and the technology
[Albtelecom](Albtelecom "wikilink"),
[Vodafone](Vodafone_Albania "wikilink"), [Telekom
Albania](Telekom_Albania "wikilink") and others.

In 2012, Albania\'s [GDP per capita](GDP_per_capita "wikilink") stood at
30% of the [European Union](European_Union "wikilink") average, while
[GDP (PPP) per capita](GDP_(PPP)_per_capita "wikilink") was 35%.[^241]
Albania was one of three countries in Europe to record an economic
growth in the first quarter of 2010 after the [global financial
crisis](global_financial_crisis "wikilink").[^242][^243] The
[International Monetary Fund](International_Monetary_Fund "wikilink")
predicted 2.6% growth for Albania in 2010 and 3.2% in 2011.[^244]
According to *[Forbes](Forbes "wikilink")*,
`{{as of|2016|December|lc=y}}`{=mediawiki}, the [Gross Domestic Product
(GDP)](Gross_Domestic_Product_(GDP) "wikilink") was growing at 2.8%. The
country had a [trade balance](trade_balance "wikilink") of 9.7% and
[unemployment rate](unemployment_rate "wikilink") of 14.7%.[^245]
[Foreign direct investment](Foreign_direct_investment "wikilink") has
increased significantly in recent years as the government has embarked
on an ambitious programme to improve the business climate through fiscal
and legislative reforms.

### Primary sector {#primary_sector}

```{=mediawiki}
{{main|Agriculture in Albania}}
```
![Grapes in [Berat](Berat "wikilink"). Due to the [Mediterranean
climate](Mediterranean_climate "wikilink"),
[wine](Albanian_wine "wikilink"), [olives](olive "wikilink") and [citrus
fruits](citrus_fruit "wikilink") are mostly produced in Southern
Albania.](Berat_kale_-_panoramio.jpg "Grapes in Berat. Due to the Mediterranean climate, wine, olives and citrus fruits are mostly produced in Southern Albania.")

Agriculture in the country is based on small to medium-sized
family-owned dispersed units. It remains a significant sector of the
[economy of Albania](economy_of_Albania "wikilink"). It employs
41%[^246] of the population, and about 24.31% of the land is used for
agricultural purposes. One of the earliest farming sites in Europe has
been found in the southeast of the country.[^247] As part of the
pre-accession process of Albania to the [European
Union](European_Union "wikilink"), farmers are being aided through
[IPA](Instrument_for_Pre-Accession_Assistance "wikilink") funds to
improve Albanian agriculture standards.[^248]

Albania produces significant amounts of fruits (apples,
[olives](olive "wikilink"), grapes, oranges, lemons,
[apricots](apricot "wikilink"), [peaches](peach "wikilink"),
[cherries](Cherry "wikilink"), [figs](figs "wikilink"), [sour
cherries](Prunus_cerasus "wikilink"), [plums](plum "wikilink"), and
[strawberries](Strawberry "wikilink")),
[vegetables](Vegetable_oil "wikilink") (potatoes, tomatoes, maize,
onions, and wheat), [sugar beets](sugar_beet "wikilink"), tobacco, meat,
[honey](honey "wikilink"), [dairy products](dairy_product "wikilink"),
traditional medicine and [aromatic plants](Essential_oil "wikilink").
Further, the country is a worldwide significant producer of
[salvia](salvia "wikilink"), [rosemary](rosemary "wikilink") and [yellow
gentian](Gentiana_lutea "wikilink").[^249] The country\'s proximity to
the [Ionian Sea](Ionian_Sea "wikilink") and the [Adriatic
Sea](Adriatic_Sea "wikilink") give the underdeveloped fishing industry
great potential. The [World Bank](World_Bank "wikilink") and [European
Community](European_Community "wikilink") economists report that,
Albania\'s fishing industry has good potential to generate export
earnings because prices in the nearby Greek and Italian markets are many
times higher than those in the Albanian market. The fish available off
the coasts of the country are [carp](carp "wikilink"),
[trout](trout "wikilink"), [sea bream](sea_bream "wikilink"),
[mussels](mussel "wikilink") and [crustaceans](crustacean "wikilink").

Albania has one of Europe\'s longest histories of
[viticulture](viticulture "wikilink").[^250] Today\'s region was one of
the few places where vine was naturally grown during the ice age. The
oldest found seeds in the region are 4,000 to 6,000 years old.[^251] In
2009, the nation produced an estimated 17,500 tonnes of wine.[^252]

### Secondary sector {#secondary_sector}

```{=mediawiki}
{{See also|Category:Mines in Albania}}
```
![The [Antea](Antea_Cement "wikilink") factory in
[Fush-Kruj](Fush-Kruj "wikilink")](Something_in_Albania_(10759257413).jpg "The Antea factory in Fush-Kruj")

The secondary sector of Albania has undergone many changes and
diversification since the collapse of the communist regime in the
country. It is very diversified, from
[electronics](Electronics_industry "wikilink"),
[manufacturing](Manufacturing_industries "wikilink"),[^253]
[textiles](Textile_industry "wikilink"), to
[food](Food_industry "wikilink"), [cement](Cement_industry "wikilink"),
[mining](Mining_industry "wikilink"),[^254] and
[energy](Energy_industry "wikilink"). The [Antea
Cement](Antea_Cement "wikilink") plant in
[Fush-Kruj](Fush-Kruj "wikilink") is considered one of the largest
industrial greenfield investments in the country.[^255] Albanian oil and
gas represents of the most promising, albeit strictly regulated, sectors
of its economy. Albania has the [second largest oil
deposits](List_of_countries_by_proven_oil_reserves "wikilink") in the
[Balkan peninsula](Balkan_peninsula "wikilink") after
[Romania](Romania "wikilink"), and the largest [oil
reserves](Patos-Marinza_Oil_Field "wikilink")[^256] in Europe. The
[Albpetrol](Albpetrol "wikilink") company is owned by the Albanian state
and monitors the state petroleum agreements in the country. The textile
industry has seen an extensive expansion by approaching companies from
the [European Union](European_Union "wikilink") (EU) in Albania.
According to the [Institute of Statistics
(INSTAT)](Institute_of_Statistics_(Albania) "wikilink")
`{{As of|2016|lc=y}}`{=mediawiki}, the textile production marked an
annual growth of 5.3% and an annual turnover of around 1.5 billion
euros.[^257]

Albania is a significant minerals producer and is ranked among the
world\'s leading [chromium](chromium "wikilink") producers and
exporters.[^258] The nation is also a notable producer of copper,
[nickel](nickel "wikilink") and coal.[^259] The [Batra
mine](Batra_mine "wikilink"), [Bulqiz mine](Bulqiz_mine "wikilink"),
and [Thekna mine](Thekna_mine "wikilink") are among the most recognised
Albanian mines that are still in operation.

### Tertiary sector {#tertiary_sector}

```{=mediawiki}
{{See also|Banking in Albania|Telecommunications in Albania|Tourism in Albania|l1=Banking|l2=Telecommunications}}
```
![The [Islets of Ksamil](Islets_of_Ksamil "wikilink"), in the south of
the [Albanian Ionian Sea
Coast](Albanian_Ionian_Sea_Coast "wikilink")](Ksamil_Albania_._Albanian_Riviera.jpg "The Islets of Ksamil, in the south of the Albanian Ionian Sea Coast")

The [tertiary sector](tertiary_sector "wikilink") represents the fastest
growing sector of the country\'s economy. 36% of the population work in
the service sector which contributes to 65% of the country\'s GDP.[^260]
Ever since the end of the 20th century, the [banking
industry](banking_industry "wikilink") is a major component of the
tertiary sector and remains in good conditions overall due to
[privatisation](privatisation "wikilink") and the commendable [monetary
policy](monetary_policy "wikilink").[^261][^262]

Previously one of the most [isolated](Isolationism "wikilink") and
controlled countries in the world, [telecommunication
industry](telecommunication_industry "wikilink") represents nowadays
another major contributor to the sector. It developed largely through
privatisation and subsequent investment by both domestic and foreign
investors.[^263] [Eagle](Eagle_Mobile "wikilink"),
[Vodafone](Vodafone_Albania "wikilink") and [Telekom
Albania](Telekom_Albania "wikilink") are the leading [telecommunications
service providers](telecommunications_service_provider "wikilink") in
the country.

Tourism is recognised as an industry of national importance and has been
steadily increasing since the beginnings of the 21st
century.[^264][^265] It directly accounted for 8.4% of GDP in 2016
though including indirect contributions pushes the proportion to
26%.[^266] In the same year, the country received approximately
4.74 million visitors mostly from across Europe and the United States as
well.[^267]

The increase of foreign visitors has been dramatic. Albania had only
500,000 visitors in 2005, while in 2012 had an estimated 4.2 million, an
increase of 740 percent in only 7 years. In 2015, tourism in summer
increased by 25 percent in contrast the previous year according to the
country\'s tourism agency.[^268] In 2011, [Lonely
Planet](Lonely_Planet "wikilink") named as a top travel
destination,[^269]`{{failed verification|date=November 2017|reason=How could a 2011 article talk about 2015? anyway link needs updating}}`{=mediawiki}
while *[The New York Times](The_New_York_Times "wikilink")* placed
Albania as number 4 global touristic destination in 2014.[^270]

The bulk of the tourist industry is concentrated along the
[Adriatic](Adriatic "wikilink") and [Ionian Sea](Ionian_Sea "wikilink")
in the west of the country. However, the [Albanian
Riviera](Albanian_Riviera "wikilink") in the southwest has the most
scenic and pristine beaches; its coastline has a considerable length of
`{{convert|446|km|abbr=off}}`{=mediawiki}.[^271] The coast has a
particular character because it is rich in varieties of virgin beaches,
capes, coves, covered bays, lagoons, small gravel beaches, sea caves and
many landforms. Some parts of this seaside are very clean ecologically,
which represent in this prospective unexplored areas, which are very
rare within the [Mediterranean](Mediterranean "wikilink").[^272] Other
attractions include the mountainous areas such as the [Albanian
Alps](Albanian_Alps "wikilink"), [Ceraunian
Mountains](Ceraunian_Mountains "wikilink") and [Korab](Korab "wikilink")
Mountains but also the historical cities of [Berat](Berat "wikilink"),
[Durrs](Durrs "wikilink"), [Gjirokastr](Gjirokastr "wikilink"),
[Sarand](Sarand "wikilink"), [Shkodr](Shkodr "wikilink") and
[Kor](Kor "wikilink").

### Transport

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Transport in Albania}}
```
![[Rruga e Kombit](Durrs-Kuks_Highway "wikilink") connects the
[Adriatic Sea](Adriatic_Sea "wikilink") across the [Western
Lowlands](Western_Lowlands "wikilink") with the [Albanian
Alps](Albanian_Alps "wikilink").](Autostrada_Durrs-Morina-05.jpg "Rruga e Kombit connects the Adriatic Sea across the Western Lowlands with the Albanian Alps.")
![[Tirana International
Airport](Tirana_International_Airport "wikilink") is named in honour of
the Albanian nun and missionary [Mother
Teresa](Mother_Teresa "wikilink").](Terminal_jashte.jpg "Tirana International Airport is named in honour of the Albanian nun and missionary Mother Teresa.")

Transportation in Albania is managed within the functions of the
[Ministry of Infrastructure and
Energy](Ministry_of_Infrastructure_and_Energy_(Albania) "wikilink") and
entities such as the [Albanian Road
Authority](Albanian_Road_Authority "wikilink") (ARRSH), responsible for
the construction and maintenance of the
[highways](Highways_in_Albania "wikilink") and
[motorways](motorways_in_Albania "wikilink") in Albania, as well as the
[Albanian Aviation
Authority](Civil_Aviation_Authority_(Albania) "wikilink") (AAC), with
the responsibility of coordinating civil aviation and airports in the
country.

The [international
airport](Tirana_International_Airport_Nn_Tereza "wikilink") of
[Tirana](Tirana "wikilink") is the premier air gateway to the country,
and is also the principal hub for Albania\'s national [flag
carrier](flag_carrier "wikilink") airline, [Air
Albania](Air_Albania "wikilink"). The airport carried more than 3.3
million passengers in 2019 with connections to many destinations in
other countries around [Europe](Europe "wikilink"),
[Africa](Africa "wikilink") and [Asia](Asia "wikilink").[^273] The
country plans to progressively increase the number of airports
especially in the south with possible locations in
[Sarand](Sarand "wikilink"), [Gjirokastr](Gjirokastr "wikilink") and
[Vlor](Vlor_International_Airport "wikilink").[^274]

The [highways](Highways_in_Albania "wikilink") and [motorways in
Albania](motorways_in_Albania "wikilink") are properly maintained and
often still under construction and renovation. The [Autostrada
1](A1_motorway_(Albania) "wikilink") (A1) represents an integral
transportation corridor in Albania and the longest motorway of the
country. It will prospectively link [Durrs](Durrs "wikilink") on the
Adriatic Sea across [Pristina](Pristina "wikilink") in Kosovo with the
[Pan-European Corridor X](Pan-European_Corridor_X "wikilink") in
Serbia.[^275][^276] The [Autostrada 2](A2_motorway_(Albania) "wikilink")
(A2) is part of the [Adriatic--Ionian
Corridor](AdriaticIonian_motorway "wikilink") as well as the
[Pan-European Corridor VIII](Pan-European_Corridor_VIII "wikilink") and
connects [Fier](Fier "wikilink") with [Vlor](Vlor "wikilink").[^277]
The [Autostrada 3](A3_motorway_(Albania) "wikilink") (A3) is currently
under construction and will connect, after its completion,
[Tirana](Tirana "wikilink") and [Elbasan](Elbasan "wikilink") with the
Pan-European Corridor VIII. When all three corridors are completed,
Albania will have an estimated `{{convert|759|km}}`{=mediawiki} of
highway linking it with all of its neighbouring countries.

[Durrs](Port_of_Durrs "wikilink") is the busiest and largest
[seaport](seaport "wikilink") in the country, followed by
[Vlor](Port_of_Vlor "wikilink"),
[Shngjin](Port_of_Shngjin "wikilink") and
[Sarand](Port_of_Sarand "wikilink"). `{{as of|2014}}`{=mediawiki}, it
is as one of the largest passenger ports on the [Adriatic
Sea](Adriatic_Sea "wikilink") with annual passenger volume of
approximately 1.5 million. The principal ports serve a system of ferries
connecting Albania with numerous islands and coastal cities in Croatia,
Greece and Italy.

The rail network is administered by the national railway company
[Hekurudha Shqiptare](Hekurudha_Shqiptare "wikilink") which was
extensively promoted by the dictator [Enver
Hoxha](Enver_Hoxha "wikilink"). There has been a considerable increase
in private car ownership and bus usage while rail use decreased since
the end of communism. However, a new railway line from Tirana and its
airport to Durrs is currently planned. The specific location of this
railway, connecting the most populated urban areas in Albania, makes it
an important economic development project.[^278][^279]

## Infrastructure

### Education

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Education in Albania}}
```
![The [University of Arts](University_of_Arts_(Albania) "wikilink") is
the largest higher education institute dedicated to the study of
arts.](Akademia_e_arteve_Ergys_Veliu_Photography.jpg "The University of Arts is the largest higher education institute dedicated to the study of arts.")

In the country, education is secular, free,
[compulsory](Compulsory_education "wikilink") and based on three levels
of education segmented in primary, secondary and tertiary
education.[^280][^281] The academic year is apportioned into two
semesters beginning in September or October, and ending in June or July.
[Albanian](Albanian_language "wikilink") serves as the [primary
language](primary_language "wikilink") of instruction in all [academic
institutions](state_school "wikilink") across the country.[^282] The
study of a first [foreign language](foreign_language "wikilink") is
mandatory and taught most often at elementary and bilingual
schools.[^283] The languages taught in schools are English, Italian,
French and German.[^284] The country has a [school life
expectancy](school_life_expectancy "wikilink") of 16 years and a
[literacy rate](literacy_rate "wikilink") of 98.7%, with 99.2% for males
and 98.3% for females.[^285][^286]

Compulsory primary education is divided into two levels, elementary and
secondary school, from grade one to five and six to nine,
respectively.[^287] Pupils are required to attend school from the age of
six until they turn 16. Upon successful completion of primary education,
all pupils are entitled to attend high schools with specialising in any
particular field including arts, [sports](sport "wikilink"),
[languages](language "wikilink"), sciences or technology.[^288]

The country\'s tertiary education, an optional stage of formal learning
following secondary education, has undergone a thorough reformation and
restructuring in compliance with the principles of the [Bologna
Process](Bologna_Process "wikilink"). There is a significant number of
private and public [institutions of higher
education](institutions_of_higher_education "wikilink") well dispersed
in the major cities of Albania.[^289][^290] Studies in tertiary
education are organised at three successive levels which include the
[bachelor](Bachelor's_degree "wikilink"),
[master](Master's_degree "wikilink") and
[doctorate](Doctorate_Degree "wikilink").

### Health

![The [Albanian cuisine](Albanian_cuisine "wikilink") from the
Mediterranean, which is characterised by the use of fruits, vegetables
and [olive oil](olive_oil "wikilink"), contributes to the good nutrition
of the country\'s
population.[^291]](Olive-oil-1412361_1920.jpg "The Albanian cuisine from the Mediterranean, which is characterised by the use of fruits, vegetables and olive oil, contributes to the good nutrition of the country's population.")

The [constitution of Albania](constitution_of_Albania "wikilink")
guarantees equal, free and [universal health
care](universal_health_care "wikilink") for all its citizens.[^293] The
health care system of the country is currently organised in three
levels, among others [primary](Primary_healthcare "wikilink"),
[secondary](Secondary_care "wikilink") and [tertiary
healthcare](tertiary_healthcare "wikilink"), and is in a process of
modernisation and development.[^294][^295] The [life
expectancy](life_expectancy "wikilink") at birth in Albania is at 77.8
years and ranks [37th](List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy "wikilink")
in the world outperforming several [developed
countries](developed_countries "wikilink").[^296] The average [healthy
life expectancy](Life_expectancy#Healthy_life_expectancy "wikilink") is
at 68.8 years and ranks as well 37th in the world.[^297] The country\'s
[infant mortality rate](infant_mortality_rate "wikilink") is estimated
at 12 per 1,000 live births in 2015. In 2000, the country had the 55th
best healthcare performance in the world, as defined by the [World
Health Organization](World_Health_Organization "wikilink").[^298]

[Cardiovascular disease](Cardiovascular_disease "wikilink") remain the
principal cause of death in the country accounting 52% of total
deaths.[^299] [Accidents](Accident "wikilink"), injuries,
[malignant](Malignant_disease "wikilink") and [respiratory
diseases](respiratory_disease "wikilink") are other primary causes of
death.[^300] [Neuropsychiatric
disease](Neuropsychiatric_disorders "wikilink") has also increased due
to recent demographic, social and economic changes in the country.[^301]

In 2009, the country had a fruit and vegetable supply of 886 grams per
capita per day, the fifth highest supply in Europe.[^302] In comparison
to other developed and developing countries, Albania has a relatively
low rate of [obesity](obesity "wikilink") probably thanks to the health
benefits of the [Mediterranean
diet](Mediterranean_diet "wikilink").[^303][^304] According to [World
Health Organization data from
2016](List_of_countries_by_Body_Mass_Index_(BMI)#WHO_Data_on_Prevalence_of_Obesity_(BMI_above_30)_(2014) "wikilink"),
21.7% of adults in the country are clinically
[overweight](overweight "wikilink"), with a [Body mass
index](Body_mass_index "wikilink") (BMI) score of 25 or more.[^305]

```
![Electricity production in Albania from 1980 to
2019](Albania_electricity_production.svg "Electricity production in Albania from 1980 to 2019")

Due to its geographical location and natural resources, Albania has a
wide variety of [energy resources](energy_resource "wikilink") ranging
from gas, oil and coal, to [wind](Wind_energy "wikilink"),
[solar](Solar_energy "wikilink") and [water](hydropower "wikilink") as
well as other [renewable](renewable_energy "wikilink")
sources.[^306][^307] According to the 2023 Energy Transition Index (ETI)
published by the [World Economic
Forum](World_Economic_Forum "wikilink"), the country was ranked at
position number 21 globally highlighting the notable progress in its
energy transition agenda.[^308] Currently, the electricity generation
sector of Albania is dependent on
[hydroelectricity](hydroelectricity "wikilink") simultaneously ranking
fifth in the world in percentage terms.[^309][^310][^311] The
[Drin](Drin_(river) "wikilink"), located in the north, hosts four
[hydroelectric power stations](hydroelectric_power_station "wikilink"),
including [Fierza](Fierza_Hydroelectric_Power_Station "wikilink"),
[Koman](Koman_Hydroelectric_Power_Station "wikilink"),
[Skavica](Skavica_Hydro_Power_Plant "wikilink") and [Vau i
Dejs](Vau_i_Dejs_Hydroelectric_Power_Station "wikilink"). Two other
power stations, such as the [Banj](Banj_Hydro_Power_Plant "wikilink")
and [Moglic](Moglic_Hydro_Power_Plant "wikilink"), are located along
the [Devoll](Devoll_(river) "wikilink") in the south.[^312]

Albania has considerable deposits of oil. It has the 10th largest oil
reserves in Europe and the 58th in the world.[^313] The country\'s main
petroleum deposits are located around the [Albanian Adriatic Sea
Coast](Albanian_Adriatic_Sea_Coast "wikilink") and
[Myzeqe](Myzeqe "wikilink") Plain within the [Western
Lowlands](Western_Lowlands "wikilink"), where the country\'s largest
reserve is located. [Patos-Marinza](Patos-Marinza_Oil_Field "wikilink"),
also located within the area, is the largest onshore [oil
field](oil_field "wikilink") in Europe.[^314] The [Trans Adriatic
Pipeline](Trans_Adriatic_Pipeline "wikilink") (TAP), part of the planned
[Southern Gas Corridor](Southern_Gas_Corridor "wikilink"), runs for
`{{convert|215|km|0|abbr=off}}`{=mediawiki} across Albania\'s territory
before entering the [Albanian Adriatic Sea
Coast](Albanian_Adriatic_Sea_Coast "wikilink") approximately
`{{convert|17|km|0|abbr=off}}`{=mediawiki} northwest of
[Fier](Fier "wikilink").[^315]

The [water resources](water_resources "wikilink") of Albania are
particularly abundant in all the regions of the country and comprise
[lakes](Lakes_of_Albania "wikilink"),
[rivers](Rivers_of_Albania "wikilink"), springs and groundwater
aquifers.[^316] The country\'s available average quantity of [fresh
water](fresh_water "wikilink") is estimated at
`{{convert|129.7|m3|0|abbr=off}}`{=mediawiki} per inhabitant per year,
which is one of the highest rates in Europe.[^317] According to the data
presented by the [Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and
Sanitation](Joint_Monitoring_Programme_for_Water_Supply_and_Sanitation "wikilink")
(JMP) in 2015, about 93% of the country\'s total population had access
to [improved sanitation](improved_sanitation "wikilink").[^318]

The [freedom of press](freedom_of_press "wikilink") and
[speech](Freedom_of_speech "wikilink"), and the right to free expression
is guaranteed in the [constitution of
Albania](constitution_of_Albania "wikilink").[^319] Albania was ranked
84th on the [Press Freedom Index](Press_Freedom_Index "wikilink") of
2020 compiled by the [Reporters Without
Borders](Reporters_Without_Borders "wikilink"), with its score steadily
declining since 2003.[^320] Nevertheless, in the 2020 report of [Freedom
in the World](Freedom_in_the_World "wikilink"), the [Freedom
House](Freedom_House "wikilink") classified the freedoms of press and
speech in Albania as partly free from political interference and
manipulation.[^321]

[Radio Televizioni Shqiptar](Radio_Televizioni_Shqiptar "wikilink")
(RTSH) is the [national broadcaster](national_broadcaster "wikilink")
corporation of Albania operating numerous television and radio stations
in the country.[^322] The three major private broadcaster corporations
are [Top Channel](Top_Channel "wikilink"), [Televizioni
Klan](TV_Klan "wikilink") and [Vizion Plus](Vizion_Plus "wikilink")
whose content are distributed throughout Albania and beyond its
territory in [Kosovo](Kosovo "wikilink") and other
[Albanian-speaking](Albanian_language "wikilink") territories.[^323]

Albanian cinema has its roots in the 20th century and developed after
the country\'s [declaration of
independence](Albanian_Declaration_of_Independence "wikilink").[^324]
The first [movie theater](movie_theater "wikilink") exclusively devoted
to showing [motion pictures](motion_pictures "wikilink") was built in
1912 in [Shkodr](Shkodr "wikilink").[^325] During the [Peoples
Republic of Albania](Peoples_Republic_of_Albania "wikilink"), Albanian
cinema developed rapidly with the inauguration of the [Kinostudio
Shqipria e Re](Kinostudio_Shqipria_e_Re "wikilink") in Tirana.[^326]
In 1953, the Albanian-Soviet [epic film](epic_film "wikilink"), the
[Great Warrior Skanderbeg](The_Great_Warrior_Skanderbeg "wikilink"), was
released chronicling the life and fight of the medieval Albanian hero
[Skanderbeg](Gjergj_Kastriot_Skanderbeg "wikilink"). It went on to win
the international prize at the [1954 Cannes Film
Festival](1954_Cannes_Film_Festival "wikilink"). In 2003, the [Tirana
International Film
Festival](Tirana_International_Film_Festival "wikilink") was
established, the largest film festival in the country. The [Durrs
Amphitheatre](Durrs_Amphitheatre "wikilink") is host to the [Durrs
International Film
Festival](Durrs_International_Film_Festival "wikilink"), the second
largest film festival.

### Technology

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Science and technology in Albania|Telecommunications in Albania|l1=Technology}}
```
After the [fall of communism](Fall_of_communism_in_Albania "wikilink")
in 1991, human resources in sciences and technology in Albania have
drastically decreased. As of various reports, during 1991 to 2005
approximately 50% of the professors and scientists of the universities
and science institutions in the country have left Albania.[^327] In
2009, the [government](Government_of_Albania "wikilink") approved the
National Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation in Albania
covering the period 2009 to 2015.[^328] It aims to triple public
spending on [research and
development](research_and_development "wikilink") to 0.6% of GDP and
augment the share of [GDE](Gross_domestic_expenditure_on_R&D "wikilink")
from foreign sources, including the framework programmes for research of
the [European Union](European_Union "wikilink"), to the point where it
covers 40% of research spending, among others. Albania was ranked 83rd
in the [Global Innovation Index](Global_Innovation_Index "wikilink") in
2023.[^329][^330]

Telecommunication represents one of the fastest growing and dynamic
sectors in Albania.[^331][^332] [Vodafone
Albania](Vodafone_Albania "wikilink"), [Telekom
Albania](Telekom_Albania "wikilink") and
[Albtelecom](Albtelecom "wikilink") are the three large providers of
[mobile](Mobile_network_operator "wikilink") and
[internet](internet "wikilink") in Albania.[^333] As of the [Electronic
and Postal Communications
Authority](Electronic_and_Postal_Communications_Authority_(Albania) "wikilink")
(AKEP) in 2018, the country had approximately 2.7 million active mobile
users with almost 1.8 million active broadband subscribers.[^334]
Vodafone Albania alone served more than 931,000 mobile users, Telekom
Albania had about 605,000 users and Albtelecom had more than 272,000
users.[^335] In [January
2023](List_of_spaceflight_launches_in_JanuaryJune_2023 "wikilink"),
Albania launched its [first two
satellites](List_of_first_satellites_by_country "wikilink"), *Albania 1*
and *Albania 2*, into [orbit](orbit "wikilink"), in what was regarded as
a milestone effort in monitoring the country\'s territory and
identifying illegal activities.[^336][^337] Albanian-American engineer
[Mira Murati](Mira_Murati "wikilink"), the Chief Technology Officer of
research organization [OpenAI](OpenAI "wikilink"), played a substantial
role in the development and launch of artificial intelligence services
such as [ChatGPT](ChatGPT "wikilink"), [Codex](OpenAI_Codex "wikilink")
and [DALL-E](DALL-E "wikilink").[^338][^339][^340] In December 2023,
Prime Minister Edi Rama announced plans for collaboration between the
Albanian government and ChatGPT, facilitated by discussions with
Murati.[^341][^342] Rama emphasised the intention to streamline the
alignment of Albanian laws with the regulations of the European Union,
aiming to reduce costs associated with translation and legal
services.[^343]

## Demography

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Demographics of Albania|l1=Demography of Albania}}

```
![Development of the [population of
Albania](Demographics_of_Albania "wikilink") over the last sixty
years](Albania_demography.svg "Development of the population of Albania over the last sixty years")

As defined by the [Institute of
Statistics](Institute_of_Statistics_(Albania) "wikilink") (INSTAT), the
[population](Demographics_of_Albania "wikilink") of Albania was
estimated in 2020 at 2,845,955.[^344] The country\'s [total fertility
rate](total_fertility_rate "wikilink") of 1.51 children born per woman
is one of the [lowest in the
world](List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_fertility_rate "wikilink").[^345]
Its [population
density](List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_population_density "wikilink")
stands at 259 inhabitants per square kilometre. The overall [life
expectancy](List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy "wikilink") at birth is
78.5 years; 75.8 years for males and 81.4 years for females.[^346] The
country is the [8th most populous
country](Balkans#Demographics "wikilink") in the
[Balkans](Balkans "wikilink") and ranks as the [137th most populous
country](List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population "wikilink") in
the world. The country\'s population rose steadily from 2.5 million in
1979 until 1989, when it peaked at 3.1 million.[^347] Since then, the
population has continually decreased every year.[^348] It is forecast
that the population will continue shrinking for the next decade at
least, depending on the actual [birth rate](birth_rate "wikilink") and
the level of [net migration](Net_migration_rate "wikilink").[^349] In
2022, over 46,000 people migrated out of Albania, a 10% increase over
the previous year.[^350]

The explanation for the recent population decrease is the [fall of
communism in Albania](fall_of_communism_in_Albania "wikilink") in the
late twentieth century. That period was marked by economic [mass
emigration](mass_migration "wikilink") from Albania to
[Greece](Greece "wikilink"), Italy and the United States. The migration
affected the country\'s internal population distribution. It decreased
particularly in the north and south, while it increased in the centre
within the cities of [Tirana](Tirana "wikilink") and
[Durrs](Durrs "wikilink").`{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}`{=mediawiki}
Migration abroad has continued in recent years, particularly of the
young and educated. As much as a third of those born in the country\'s
borders now live outside of it, making Albania one of the countries with
the highest rate of outmigration relative to its population in the
world.[^351][^352] In 2022 the birth rate was 20% lower than in 2021,
largely due to emigration of people of childbearing age.[^353]

About 53.4% of the country\'s
[population](Demographics_of_Albania "wikilink") lives in cities. The
three largest counties by population account for half of the total
population. Almost 30% of the total population is found in [Tirana
County](Tirana_County "wikilink") followed by [Fier
County](Fier_County "wikilink") with 11% and [Durrs
County](Durrs_County "wikilink") with 10%.[^354] Over one million
people are concentrated in [Tirana](Tirana "wikilink") and
[Durrs](Durrs "wikilink"), making it the largest urban area in
Albania.[^355] [Tirana](Tirana "wikilink") is one of largest cities in
the [Balkan Peninsula](Balkan_Peninsula "wikilink") and ranks seventh
with a population about 400,000.

### Minorities

```{=mediawiki}
{{main|Minorities of Albania}}
```

{{update section|date=May 2023}}
```
Albania recognises nine national or cultural minorities:
[Aromanian](Aromanians "wikilink"), [Greek](Greeks "wikilink"),
[Macedonian](Macedonians_(ethnic_group) "wikilink"),
[Montenegrin](Montenegrins "wikilink"), [Serb](Serbs "wikilink"),
[Roma](Romani_people "wikilink"),
[Egyptian](Egyptians_(Balkans) "wikilink"), Bosnian and
[Bulgarian](Bulgarians "wikilink") peoples.[^357] Other Albanian
minorities are the [Gorani people](Gorani_people "wikilink") and
Jews.[^358] Contrary to official statistics that show an over 97 per
cent Albanian majority in the country, minority groups (such as
[Greeks](Greeks_in_Albania "wikilink"),
[Macedonians](Macedonians_in_Albania "wikilink"),
[Montenegrins](Montenegrins_of_Albania "wikilink"),
[Roma](Roma_in_Albania "wikilink") and
[Aromanians](Aromanians_in_Albania "wikilink")) have frequently disputed
the official numbers, asserting a higher percentage of the country\'s
population. According to the disputed 2011 census, ethnic affiliation
was as follows: [Albanians](Albanians "wikilink") 2,312,356 (82.6% of
the total), [Greeks](Greeks_in_Albania "wikilink") 24,243 (0.9%),
[Macedonians](Macedonians_of_Albania "wikilink") 5,512 (0.2%),
[Montenegrins](Montenegrins_of_Albania "wikilink") 366 (0.01%),
[Aromanians](Aromanians "wikilink") 8,266 (0.30%),
[Romani](Romani_people "wikilink") 8,301 (0.3%), [Balkan
Egyptians](Balkan_Egyptians "wikilink") 3,368 (0.1%), other ethnicities
2,644 (0.1%), no declared ethnicity 390,938 (14.0%), and not relevant
44,144 (1.6%).[^359] On the quality of the specific data the Advisory
Committee on the [Framework Convention for the Protection of National
Minorities](Framework_Convention_for_the_Protection_of_National_Minorities "wikilink")
stated that \"the results of the census should be viewed with the utmost
caution and calls on the authorities not to rely exclusively on the data
on nationality collected during the census in determining its policy on
the protection of national minorities\".[^360]

Regarding the Greeks, estimates vary between 60,000 and 300,000 ethnic
Greeks in Albania. According to Ian Jeffries, most Western sources put
the number at around 200,000. The 300,000 mark is supported by Greek
government as
well.[^361]`{{cite book|title=RFE/RL Research Report: Weekly Analyses from the RFE/RL Research Institute|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RxgkAQAAIAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Incorporated|quote=Albanian officials alleged that the priest was promoting irredentist sentiments among Albania's Greek minority&nbsp; estimated at between 60,000 and 300,000.}}`{=mediawiki}

```
[^362][^363][^364][^365] The [CIA World
Factbook](CIA_World_Factbook "wikilink") estimates the Greek minority to
constitute 0.9%[^366] of the population. The US State Department
estimates that Greeks make up 1.17%, and other minorities 0.23%, of the
population.[^367] The latter questions the validity of the census data
about the Greek minority, as measurements have been affected by
boycott.[^368]

The [official language](official_language "wikilink") of the country is
[Albanian](Albanian_language "wikilink") which is spoken by the vast
majority of the country\'s population.[^369] Its standard spoken and
written form is revised and merged from the two main dialects,
[Gheg](Gheg "wikilink") and [Tosk](Tosk_Albanian "wikilink"), though it
is notably based more on the Tosk dialect. The
[Shkumbin](Shkumbin "wikilink") river is the rough dividing line between
the two dialects. Among minority languages,
[Greek](Greek_language "wikilink") is the second most-spoken language in
the country, with 0.5 to 3% of the population speaking it as first
language, mainly in the country\'s south where its speakers are
concentrated.[^370][^371][^372][^373] Other languages spoken by ethnic
minorities in Albania include
[Aromanian](Aromanian_language "wikilink"),
[Serbian](Serbian_language "wikilink"),
[Macedonian](Macedonian_language "wikilink"),
[Bosnian](Bosnian_language "wikilink"),
[Bulgarian](Bulgarian_language "wikilink"),
[Gorani](Gora_dialect "wikilink"), and
[Roma](Romani_language "wikilink").[^374] Macedonian is official in the
Pustec Municipality in East Albania. According to the 2011 population
census, 2,765,610 or 98.8% of the population declared
[Albanian](Albanian_language "wikilink") as their [mother
tongue](mother_tongue "wikilink").[^375] Because of large migration
flows from Albania, over half of Albanians during their life learn a
second language. The main foreign language known is English with 40.0%,
followed by Italian with 27.8% and Greek with 22.9%. The English
speakers were mostly young people, the knowledge of Italian is stable in
every age group, while there is a decrease of the speakers of Greek in
the youngest group.[^376]

Among young people aged 25 or less, English, German and Turkish have
seen rising interest after 2000. Italian and French have had a stable
interest, while Greek has lost much of its previous interest. The trends
are linked with cultural and economic factors.[^377]

Young people have shown a growing interest in the [German
language](German_language "wikilink") in recent
years.`{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}}`{=mediawiki} Some of them go
to Germany for studying or various experiences. Albania and Germany have
agreements for cooperating in helping young people of the two countries
know both cultures better.[^378] Due to a sharp rise in economic
relations with Turkey, interest in learning Turkish, in particular among
young people, has been growing on a yearly basis.[^379]

Albania is a [secular](secular_state "wikilink") and religiously diverse
country with no [official religion](official_religion "wikilink") and
thus, [freedom of religion](freedom_of_religion "wikilink"),
[belief](freedom_of_belief "wikilink") and
[conscience](Freedom_of_conscience "wikilink") are guaranteed under the
country\'s [constitution](Constitution_of_Albania "wikilink").[^380] As
of the [2011 census](2011_Census_of_Albania "wikilink"), there were
1,587,608 (56.7%) [Sunni Muslims](Sunni_Islam "wikilink"), 280,921
(10.03%) [Catholics](Roman_Catholicism "wikilink"), 188,992 (6.75%)
[Eastern Orthodox](Eastern_Orthodoxy "wikilink"), 58,628 (2.09%)
[Bektashi Muslims](Bektashi_Order "wikilink"), 3,797 (0.14%)
[Evangelicals](Evangelicalism "wikilink"), 1,919 (0.07%) other
[Christians](Christians "wikilink"), 602 (0.02%) of other religions and
153,630 (5.49%) believers without denomination in Albania.[^381] 69,995
people (2.5%) were [irreligious](Atheism "wikilink") while 386,024
(13.79%) did not declare their religion.[^382] Albania is nevertheless
ranked among the least religious countries in the world.[^383] Religion
constitute an important role in the lives of only 39% of the country\'s
population.[^384] In another report, 56% considered themselves
religious, 30% considered themselves non-religious, while 9% defined
themselves as convinced atheists. 80% believed in God.[^385]

The preliminary results of the 2011 census seemed to give widely
different results, with 70% of respondents refusing to declare belief in
any of the listed faiths.[^386][^387] The Albanian Orthodox Church
officially refused to recognize the results, claiming that 24% of the
total population adhered to its faith.[^388][^389] Some Muslim Community
officials expressed unhappiness with the data claiming that many Muslims
were not counted and that the number of adherents numbered some 70% of
the Albanian population.[^390][^391] The Albanian Catholic Bishops
Conference also cast doubts on the census, complaining that many of its
believers were not contacted.[^392] The [Muslim
Albanians](Islam_in_Albania "wikilink") are spread throughout the
country. [Orthodox](Orthodoxy_in_Albania "wikilink") and
[Bektashis](Bektashi "wikilink") are mostly found in the south, whereas
[Catholics](Catholicism_in_Albania "wikilink") mainly live in the
north.[^393] In 2008, there were 694 [Catholic](Catholic "wikilink")
churches and 425 [orthodox](Eastern_Orthodox_Church "wikilink")
churches, 568 mosques and 70 [bektashi](Bektashi_Order "wikilink")
[tekkes](Khanqah "wikilink") in the country.[^394][^395]

![Representatives of the Sunni, Orthodox, Bektashi and Catholic Albanian
communities in
[Paris](Paris "wikilink")](Marche_Charlie_Hebdo_Paris_02.jpg "Representatives of the Sunni, Orthodox, Bektashi and Catholic Albanian communities in Paris")

During [modern times](Modern_history "wikilink"), the Albanian
republican, monarchic and later communist regimes followed a systematic
policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life.
The country has never had an [official
religion](official_religion "wikilink") either as a republic or as a
kingdom. In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened
under the monarchy and ultimately eradicated during the 1950s and 1960s,
under the state policy of obliterating all organised religion from the
territories of Albania. The [communist
regime](Communism_in_Albania "wikilink") persecuted and suppressed
religious observance and institutions and entirely [banned
religion](anti-religious "wikilink"). The country was then officially
declared to be the world\'s first [atheist
state](atheist_state "wikilink"). Religious freedom has returned,
however, since the [end of
communism](Fall_of_communism_in_Albania "wikilink").

Islam survived communist era persecution and reemerged in the modern era
as a practised religion in Albania.[^396] Some smaller Christian sects
in Albania include [Evangelicals](Evangelicalism "wikilink") and several
[Protestant](Protestant "wikilink") communities including [Seventh-day
Adventist Church](Seventh-day_Adventist_Church "wikilink"), [Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints](The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints "wikilink") and
[Jehovah\'s
Witnesses](Jehovah's_Witnesses "wikilink").[^397][^398][^399][^400] The
first recorded Protestant of Albania was Said Toptani, who travelled
around Europe and returned to [Tirana](Tirana "wikilink") in 1853, where
he preached [Protestantism](Protestantism "wikilink"). The first
[evangelical Protestants](evangelical_Protestants "wikilink") appeared
in the 19th century and the Evangelical Alliance was founded in 1892.
Nowadays, it has 160 member congregations from different Protestant
denominations. Following mass emigration to Israel after the fall of
communism, there are only 200 Albanian
[Jews](Judaism_in_Albania "wikilink") left in the country.[^401][^402]

## Culture

{{Main|Culture of Albania}}
```
### Symbols

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|National symbols of Albania}}
```
![The [helmet](Arms_of_Skanderbeg "wikilink") of [Gjergj Kastrioti
Skanderbeg](Skanderbeg "wikilink") stands as an emblem of Albanian
independence.](Casque_Skanderbeg_Vienne.jpg "The helmet of Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg stands as an emblem of Albanian independence.")

The red and black [national colours](national_colours "wikilink") are
displayed on the [flag of Albania](flag_of_Albania "wikilink") that is
adorned with a [double-headed eagle](double-headed_eagle "wikilink") as
the foremost recognised [national symbol of
Albania](National_symbols_of_Albania "wikilink").[^403][^404][^405] With
the black eagle portraying bravery and strength, the red field
symbolises the fortitude and sacrifices of the Albanian people.[^406]
The eagle is linked with the legacy of the national hero [Gjergj
Kastrioti](Skanderbeg "wikilink"), renowned as Skanderbeg, who led a
prosperous [resistance movement](Skanderbeg's_rebellion "wikilink")
against Ottoman rule.[^407][^408][^409] Rooted in the Middle Ages, it
emerged as a [heraldic](Albanian_heraldry "wikilink")
[symbol](Armorial_of_Albania "wikilink") in the [Principality of
Arbr](Principality_of_Arbanon "wikilink") and among notable Albanian
dynasties such as the [Dukagjini](Dukagjini_family "wikilink"),
[Kastrioti](Kastrioti_family "wikilink"),
[Muzaka](Muzaka_family "wikilink") and
[Thopia](Thopia_family "wikilink") clans.[^410] Amid the [Albanian
Renaissance](Albanian_National_Awakening "wikilink"), marking the
resurgence of Albanian national identity and aspirations for
independence, the Albanian eagle regained its prominence.[^411] Its
importance reached its culmination with [Albania\'s declaration of
independence](Albanian_Declaration_of_Independence "wikilink") in 1912,
when [Ismail Qemali](Ismail_Qemali "wikilink") raised it as the national
flag in [Vlor](Vlor "wikilink").[^412]

The [coat of arms of Albania](coat_of_arms_of_Albania "wikilink") is an
adaptation of the flag of Albania and the seal of Skanderbeg.[^413] The
coat comprises the black double-headed eagle positioned at the center of
a red field.[^414] Above the eagle, it carries the [helmet of
Skanderbeg](Arms_of_Skanderbeg "wikilink") that is crowned with the head
of a golden horned goat.[^415]
`{{lang|sq|[[Ti Shqipri, m jep nder, m jep emrin Shqiptar]]|i=no}}`{=mediawiki},
which translates to \"You Albania, give me honor, give me the name
Albanian\", is the [national motto of
Albania](List_of_national_mottos "wikilink").[^416][^417] It finds its
foundation in the legacy of [national poet](national_poet "wikilink")
[Naim Frashri](Naim_Frashri "wikilink"), who held a renowned role
during the Albanian Renaissance.[^418] The [national anthem of
Albania](national_anthem "wikilink"),
\"`{{lang|sq|[[Himni i Flamurit]]|i=no}}`{=mediawiki}\", was composed by
[Asdreni](Aleksandr_Stavre_Drenova "wikilink") and adopted as such
following Albania\'s independence in 1912.[^419]

### Clothing

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Albanian national clothing|l1=Albanian traditional clothing}}
```
![The [Fustanella](Fustanella "wikilink") is designated as the [national
costume of Albania](national_costume_of_Albania "wikilink") with
profound cultural significance within Albanian
culture.](Les_Danseurs_Albanais_by_Alexandre-Gabriel_Decamps_(c._1835).jpg "The Fustanella is designated as the national costume of Albania with profound cultural significance within Albanian culture.")

[Albanian traditional clothing](Albanian_national_clothing "wikilink"),
with its contrasting variations for the northern
[Gheg](Ghegs "wikilink") and southern [Tosk
Albanians](Tosks "wikilink"), is a testament to Albania\'s history,
cultural diversity and ethnic identity.[^420] Gheg men wear a
light-colored shirt paired with wide loose-fitting trousers referred to
as the Tirq. These trousers are securely fastened by a wide woven belt,
the Brez. An integral component of their costume is the
[Xhamadan](Xhamadan "wikilink"), a woolen red velvet vest adorned with
folkloric motifs and gold patterns.[^421] They also wear a distinctive
dome-shaped hat known as the [Qeleshe](Qeleshe "wikilink"), crafted from
wool, with its origins tracing back to the
[Illyrians](Illyrians "wikilink").[^422][^423] Conversely, Tosk men opt
for the [Fustanella](Fustanella "wikilink"), a knee-length garment
designated as the national costume, typically white with pleats,
accompanied by a white shirt. They also wear a beige or dark blue
Xhamadan reminiscent of the Gheg attire. To complete their attire, men
wear knee-high socks referred to as [orape](orape "wikilink") and
leather shoes known as [Opinga](Opinga "wikilink").

The attire of Gheg and Tosk women is renowned for its rich palette of
colors and intricate filigree detailing, displayed across various
components including ear ornaments, finger rings, necklaces, belt
buckles and buttons. Key components include a long, light-toned shirt
paired with an apron, often accompanied by a woolen or felt mantle
referred to as the Xhoka. Additional upper garments, such as the Dollama
or Mintan, may be layered, along with a headscarf known as Kapica or
Shall. A distinctive variation incorporates a pair of aprons, including
the Pshtjellak at the rear and the Paranik at the front. Integral to
the traditional attire of Gheg women is the ancient
[Xhubleta](Xhubleta "wikilink").[^424] Dedicated efforts have been
undertaken to preserve and promote the dress, acknowledging its
significance as an emblem of Albanian heritage.[^425] As a testament to
its importance, the Xhubleta has been inscribed on the
[UNESCO](UNESCO "wikilink") [Intangible Cultural Heritage
List](UNESCO_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_Lists "wikilink").[^426] The
distinctive bell-shaped garment is fashioned in black and enriched with
embroidered ethnic Albanian motifs, showcasing the remarkable
craftsmanship of northern Albania.[^427] Its crafting process involves
multiple intricate stages, encompassing the preparation of shajak fabric
and the precise cutting techniques.[^428] `{{Clear}}`{=mediawiki}

### Art and architecture {#art_and_architecture}

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Albanian art|Albanian architecture|l2=architecture}}
```
![[Butrint](Butrint "wikilink") has been included in the
[UNESCO](UNESCO "wikilink") list of [World Heritage
Sites](World_Heritage_Site "wikilink") since
1992.](Amphitheatre_of_Butrint_2009.jpg "Butrint has been included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites since 1992.")

The [artistic history](Albanian_art "wikilink") of Albania has been
particularly influenced by a multitude of ancient and medieval
[people](Civilisation "wikilink"), traditions and religions. It covers a
broad spectrum with mediums and disciplines that include painting,
[pottery](pottery "wikilink"), sculpture, [ceramics](ceramic "wikilink")
and architecture all of them exemplifying a great variety in style and
shape, in different regions and period.

The rise of the [Byzantine](Byzantine_Empire "wikilink") and [Ottoman
Empire](Ottoman_Empire "wikilink") in the [Middle
Ages](Middle_Ages "wikilink") was accompanied by a corresponding growth
in [Christian](Christian_art "wikilink") and [Islamic
art](Islamic_art "wikilink") in the lands of Albania which are apparent
in examples of architecture and mosaics throughout the country.[^429]
Centuries later, the [Albanian
Renaissance](Albanian_Renaissance "wikilink") proved crucial to the
emancipation of the modern Albanian culture and saw unprecedented
developments in all fields of literature and art whereas artists sought
to return to the ideals of [Impressionism](Impressionism "wikilink") and
[Romanticism](Romanticism_(art) "wikilink").[^430] However,
[Onufri](Onufri "wikilink"), [Kol Idromeno](Kol_Idromeno "wikilink"),
[David Selenica](David_Selenica "wikilink"), [Kostandin
Shpataraku](Kostandin_Shpataraku "wikilink") and the [Zografi
Brothers](Zografi_Brothers "wikilink") are the most eminent
representatives of Albanian art.

The [architecture of Albania](architecture_of_Albania "wikilink")
reflects the legacy of various civilisations tracing back to the
[classical antiquity](classical_antiquity "wikilink"). Major cities in
Albania have evolved from within the castle to include dwellings,
religious and commercial structures, with constant redesigning of town
squares and evolution of building techniques. Nowadays, the cities and
towns reflect a whole spectrum of various [architectural
styles](architectural_style "wikilink"). In the 20th century, many
historical as well as [sacred](Sacred_architecture "wikilink") buildings
bearing the ancient influence were demolished during the [communist
era](Communism_in_Albania "wikilink").[^431]

[Ancient architecture](Ancient_architecture "wikilink") is found
throughout Albania and most visible in [Byllis](Byllis "wikilink"),
[Amantia](Amantia "wikilink"), [Phoenice](Phoenice "wikilink"),
[Apollonia](Apollonia_(Illyria) "wikilink"),
[Butrint](Butrint "wikilink"),
[Antigonia](Antigonia_(Chaonia) "wikilink"),
[Shkodr](Rozafa_Castle "wikilink") and
[Durrs](Durrs_Amphitheatre "wikilink"). Considering the long period of
rule of the [Byzantine Empire](Byzantine_Empire "wikilink"), they
introduced castles, citadels, churches and monasteries with spectacular
wealth of visible [murals](mural "wikilink") and
[frescos](fresco "wikilink"). Perhaps the best known examples can be
found in the southern Albanian cities and surroundings of
[Kor](Kor "wikilink"), [Berat](Berat "wikilink"),
[Voskopoj](Voskopoj "wikilink") and
[Gjirokastr](Gjirokastr "wikilink"). Involving the introduction of
[Ottoman architecture](Ottoman_architecture "wikilink") there was a
development of mosques and other Islamic buildings, particularly seen in
Berat and Gjirokastr.

![*Bliss*, stainless steel sculpture by contemporary artist [Helidon
Xhixha](Helidon_Xhixha "wikilink").](Bliss_by_Helidon_Xhixza.jpg "Bliss, stainless steel sculpture by contemporary artist Helidon Xhixha.")

A productive period of [Historicism](Historicism_(art) "wikilink"), [Art
Nouveau](Art_Nouveau "wikilink") and
[Neoclassicism](Neoclassicism "wikilink") merged into the 19th century,
best exemplified in [Kor](Kor "wikilink"). The 20th century brought
new architectural styles such as the modern [Italian
style](Italianate_architecture "wikilink"), which is present in
[Tirana](Tirana "wikilink") such as the [Skanderbeg
Square](Skanderbeg_Square "wikilink") and Ministries. It is also present
in Shkodr, [Vlor](Vlor "wikilink"), [Sarand](Sarand "wikilink") and
[Durrs](Durrs "wikilink"). Moreover, other towns received their
present-day Albania-unique appearance through various cultural or
economic influences.

[Socialist classicism](Socialist_classicism "wikilink") arrived during
the [communist era](Peoples_Republic_of_Albania "wikilink") in Albania
after the [Second World War](Second_World_War "wikilink"). At this
period many socialist-styled complexes, wide roads and factories were
constructed, while town squares were redesigned and numerous of historic
and important buildings demolished. Notable examples of that style
include the [Mother Teresa
Square](Mother_Teresa_Square_(Tirana) "wikilink"), [Pyramid of
Tirana](Pyramid_of_Tirana "wikilink"), [Palace of
Congresses](Palace_of_Congresses "wikilink") and so on.

Three Albanian archaeological sites are included in the list of [UNESCO
World Heritage Sites](UNESCO_World_Heritage_Site "wikilink"). These
include the ancient remains of Butrint, the medieval [Historic Centres
of Berat and
Gjirokastr](Historic_Centres_of_Berat_and_Gjirokastr "wikilink"), and
[Natural and Cultural Heritage of the Ohrid
region](Ohrid_Lake "wikilink") site shared with [North
Macedonia](North_Macedonia "wikilink") since 2019.[^432][^433]
Furthermore, the royal [Illyrian
tombs](Royal_Tombs_of_Selca_e_Poshtme "wikilink"), the remains of
[Apollonia](Apollonia_(Illyria) "wikilink"), the ancient
[Amphitheatre](Durrs_Amphitheatre "wikilink") of Durrs and the
[Fortress of Bashtov](Fortress_of_Bashtov "wikilink") has been
included on the tentative list of Albania.

### Cuisine

```
![Buk misri ([cornbread](cornbread "wikilink")) is a staple on the
Albanian
table.](Buk_kollomoqe,_buk_misri.JPG "Buk misri (cornbread) is a staple on the Albanian table.")

Throughout the centuries, [Albanian
cuisine](Albanian_cuisine "wikilink") has been widely influenced by
[Albanian culture](Albanian_culture "wikilink"),
[geography](Geography_of_Albania "wikilink") and
[history](History_of_Albania "wikilink"), and as such, different parts
of the country enjoy specific [regional
cuisines](regional_cuisine "wikilink"). Cooking traditions especially
vary between the north and the south, owing to differing
[topography](topography "wikilink") and [climate](climate "wikilink")
that essentially contribute to the excellent growth conditions for a
wide array of herbs, fruits, and vegetables.[^434]

Albanians produce and use many varieties of fruits such as
[lemons](Lemon_(fruit) "wikilink"), oranges,
[figs](Figs_(fruit) "wikilink"), and most notably,
[olives](Olive_(fruit) "wikilink"), which are perhaps the most important
element of Albanian cooking. Spices and other herbs such as
[basil](Basil_(herb) "wikilink"), [lavender](lavender "wikilink"),
[mint](Spearmint "wikilink"), [oregano](oregano "wikilink"),
[rosemary](rosemary "wikilink"), and [thyme](thyme "wikilink") are
widely used, as are vegetables such as garlic, onions,
[peppers](Bell_pepper "wikilink"), potatoes, tomatoes, as well as
[legumes](legume "wikilink") of all types.

With a coastline along the
[Adriatic](Albanian_Adriatic_Sea_Coast "wikilink") and
[Ionian](Albanian_Ionian_Sea_Coast "wikilink") in the [Mediterranean
Sea](Mediterranean_Sea "wikilink"), fish,
[crustaceans](crustacean "wikilink"), and seafood are a popular and an
integral part of the Albanian diet. Otherwise,
[lamb](Lamb_(food) "wikilink") is the traditional meat for different
holidays and [religious festivals](religious_festival "wikilink") for
both [Christians](Christianity_in_Albania "wikilink") and
[Muslims](Islam_in_Albania "wikilink"), although poultry, beef, and pork
are also in plentiful supply.

![Speca t frguar (roasted [peppers](Capsicum "wikilink")) served with
[pite](Pite_(food) "wikilink"), a traditional and prominent layered
Albanian
pie](Albanian_cuisine_-_Pite_dhe_Speca.jpg "Speca t frguar (roasted peppers) served with pite, a traditional and prominent layered Albanian pie")

[Tav kosi](Tav_kosi "wikilink") (\"[soured
milk](soured_milk "wikilink") [casserole](casserole "wikilink")\") is
the [national dish](national_dish "wikilink") of Albania, consisting of
lamb and rice baked under a thick, tart veil of
[yoghurt](yoghurt "wikilink"). Frges is another national dish, made up
of peppers, tomatoes, and [cottage cheese](cottage_cheese "wikilink").
Pite is also popular, a baked pastry with a filling of a mixture of
[spinach](spinach "wikilink") and gjiz (curd) or mish ([ground
meat](ground_meat "wikilink")).

Petulla, a traditional fried dough, is also a popular speciality, and is
served with [powdered sugar](powdered_sugar "wikilink") or [feta
cheese](feta_cheese "wikilink") and different sorts of [fruit
jams](Fruit_preserves "wikilink"). [Flia](Flia "wikilink") consists of
multiple [crpe](crpe "wikilink")-like layers brushed with cream and
served with sour cream. [Krofne](Krofne "wikilink"), similar to
[Berliner doughnuts](Berliner_(doughnut) "wikilink"), are filled with
jam, or chocolate and often eaten during winter.

Coffee is an integral part of the Albanian lifestyle. The country has
more coffee houses per capita than any other country in the world.[^435]
Tea is also enjoyed both at home or outside at cafs, bars, or
restaurants. aj Mali ([Sideritis](Sideritis "wikilink") tea) is
enormously beloved, and a part of the daily routine for most Albanians.
It is cultivated across Southern Albania and noted for its medicinal
properties. [Black tea](Black_tea "wikilink") is also popular.

[Albanian wine](Albanian_wine "wikilink") is also common throughout the
country, and has been cultivated for thousands of years. Albania has a
long and ancient history of wine production, and belongs to the [Old
World of wine producing
countries](Old_World_wine "wikilink").[^436][^437]

![[Albanian iso-polyphony](Albanian_iso-polyphony "wikilink") is
designated as an [UNESCO](UNESCO "wikilink") [Masterpiece of the Oral
and Intangible Heritage of
Humanity](Masterpieces_of_the_Oral_and_Intangible_Heritage_of_Humanity "wikilink").[^438]](A_traditional_male_folk_group_from_Skrapar.JPG "Albanian iso-polyphony is designated as an UNESCO Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.")

Albanian folk music is a prominent part of the national identity, and
continues to play a major part in overall [Albanian
music](Music_of_Albania "wikilink"). Folk music can be divided into two
stylistic groups, mainly the northern [Gheg](Gheg_Albanian "wikilink")
varieties, and southern [Lab](Labria "wikilink") and
[Tosk](Tosk_Albanian "wikilink") varieties. Northern and southern
traditions are contrasted by a rugged tone from the north, and the more
relaxed southern form of music.

Many songs concern events from [Albanian
history](History_of_Albania "wikilink") and
[culture](Culture_of_Albania "wikilink"), including traditional themes
of honour, hospitality, treachery, and revenge. The first compilation of
Albanian folk music was made by two [Himariot](Himara "wikilink")
musicians, [Neo Muka](Neo_Muko "wikilink") and Koo akali, in Paris,
during their work with Albanian soprano [Tefta
Tashko-Koo](Tefta_Tashko-Koo "wikilink"). Several
[gramophone](Phonograph_record "wikilink") compilations were recorded at
the time by the three artists, which eventually led to the recognition
of [Albanian iso-polyphony](Albanian_iso-polyphony "wikilink") as a
[UNESCO](UNESCO "wikilink") [Intangible Cultural
Heritage](UNESCO_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_Lists "wikilink").[^440]

```{=mediawiki}

is a traditional Albanian song contest organised by the national
broadcaster [Radio Televizioni
Shqiptar](Radio_Televizioni_Shqiptar "wikilink") (RTSH). The festival is
celebrated annually since its inauguration in 1962 and has launched the
careers of some of Albania\'s most successful singers including [Vae
Zela](Vae_Zela "wikilink") and [Parashqevi
Simaku](Parashqevi_Simaku "wikilink").[^441] It is significantly a music
competition among Albanian performers presenting unreleased songs in
premiere, composed by Albanian authors and voted by juries or by public.

![An excerpt from the [Meshari](Meshari "wikilink") *(The Missal)*
written by [Gjon Buzuku](Gjon_Buzuku "wikilink")
`<small>`{=html}(1555)`</small>`{=html}](Meshari.jpg "An excerpt from the Meshari (The Missal) written by Gjon Buzuku (1555)")

The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the
development of the [Albanian language](Albanian_language "wikilink") in
the area of church texts and publications. The Protestant reforms
invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary
tradition, when cleric [Gjon Buzuku](Gjon_Buzuku "wikilink") translated
the [Catholic liturgy](Catholic_liturgy "wikilink") into Albanian,
trying to do for Albanian what [Martin Luther](Martin_Luther "wikilink")
had done for German. [Meshari](Meshari "wikilink") (*The Missal*)
written by [Gjon Buzuku](Gjon_Buzuku "wikilink") was published in 1555
and is considered one of the first literary work of written Albanian
during the Middle Ages. The refined level of the language and the
stabilised orthography must be the result of an earlier tradition of
written Albanian, a tradition that is not well understood. However,
there is some fragmented evidence, pre-dating Buzuku, which indicates
that Albanian was written from at least the 14th century.

![[Parashqevi Qiriazi](Parashqevi_Qiriazi "wikilink") -- teacher and
feminist
(1880--1970)](Parashqevi-qirjazi_152_186.jpg "Parashqevi Qiriazi  teacher and feminist (18801970)")

Albanian writings from these centuries must not have been religious
texts only, but historical chronicles too. They are mentioned by the
humanist [Marin Barleti](Marin_Barleti "wikilink"), who in his book
[Siege of Shkodr](Siege_of_Shkodra_(1478)#The_Book "wikilink")
(*Rrethimi i Shkodrs*) from 1504, confirms that he leafed through such
chronicles written in the language of the people (*in vernacula lingua*)
as well as his famous biography of [Skanderbeg](Skanderbeg "wikilink")
[Historia de vita et gestis Scanderbegi Epirotarum
principis](Marin_Barleti "wikilink") (*History of Skanderbeg*) from
1508. The *History of Skanderbeg* is still the foundation of Skanderbeg
studies and is considered an Albanian cultural treasure, vital to the
formation of Albanian national self-consciousness.

During the 16th and the 17th centuries, the
[catechism](catechism "wikilink") (*E mbsuame krishter*) (Christian
Teachings) from 1592 written by [Lek
Matrnga](Lek_Matrnga "wikilink"), (*Doktrina e krishter*) (The
Christian Doctrine) from 1618 and (*Rituale romanum*) 1621 by [Pjetr
Budi](Pjetr_Budi "wikilink"), the first writer of original Albanian
[prose](prose "wikilink") and poetry, an [apology](Remorse "wikilink")
for George Castriot (1636) by [Frang Bardhi](Frang_Bardhi "wikilink"),
who also published a dictionary and [folklore](folklore "wikilink")
creations, the theological-philosophical treaty *[Cuneus
Prophetarum](Cuneus_Prophetarum "wikilink")* (The Band of Prophets)
(1685) by [Pjetr Bogdani](Pjetr_Bogdani "wikilink"), the most
universal personality of Albanian [Middle Ages](Middle_Ages "wikilink"),
were published in [Albanian](Albanian_language "wikilink"). The most
famous Albanian writer in the 20th and 21st century is probably [Ismail
Kadare](Ismail_Kadare "wikilink").

### Sports

```{=mediawiki}
{{See also|Albania at the Olympics|Albania at the Mediterranean Games}}
```
Albania participated at the [Olympic Games in
1972](1972_Summer_Olympics "wikilink") for the first time. The country
made their Winter Olympic Games debut in
[2006](Winter_Olympics_2006 "wikilink"). Albania missed the next four
games, two of them due to the 1980 and 1984 boycotts, but returned for
the 1992 games in [Barcelona](1992_Olympic_Winter_Games "wikilink").
Since then, Albania have participated in all games. Albania normally
competes in events that include swimming, athletics, weightlifting,
shooting and wrestling. The country have been represented by the
[National Olympic Committee of
Albania](National_Olympic_Committee_of_Albania "wikilink") since 1972.
The nation has participated at the [Mediterranean
Games](Mediterranean_Games "wikilink") since the games of
[1987](1987_Mediterranean_Games "wikilink") in Syria. The Albanian
athletes have won a total of 43 (8 gold, 17 silver and 18 bronze) medals
from [1987](1987_Mediterranean_Games "wikilink") to
[2013](2013_Mediterranean_Games "wikilink").

![[Arena Kombtare](Arena_Kombtare "wikilink") in central

Popular sports in Albania include
[football](Football_in_Albania "wikilink"), weightlifting,
[basketball](Albania_national_basketball_team "wikilink"), volleyball,
tennis, swimming, [rugby union](rugby_union "wikilink") and gymnastics.
Football is by far the most popular sport in Albania. It is governed by
the [Football Association of
Albania](Football_Association_of_Albania "wikilink")
(`{{lang-sq|Federata Shqiptare e Futbollit}}`{=mediawiki}, F.SH.F.),
which has membership in [FIFA](FIFA "wikilink") and
[UEFA](UEFA "wikilink").

The [Albania national football
team](Albania_national_football_team "wikilink"), ranking 51st in the
[World](FIFA_World_Rankings "wikilink") in 2017 (highest 22nd on 22
August 2015) have won the [1946 Balkan Cup](1946_Balkan_Cup "wikilink")
and the [Malta Rothmans International Tournament
2000](Rothmans_International_Tournament_2000 "wikilink"), but had never
participated in any major [UEFA](UEFA "wikilink") or
[FIFA](FIFA "wikilink") tournament, until [UEFA Euro
2016](UEFA_Euro_2016 "wikilink"), Albania\'s first ever appearance at
the continental tournament and at a major men\'s football tournament.
Albania scored their first ever goal in a major tournament and secured
their first ever win in European Championship when they beat
[Romania](Romania_national_football_team "wikilink") by 1--0 in a [UEFA
Euro 2016](UEFA_Euro_2016 "wikilink") match on 19 June 2016.[^445][^446]
The most successful football clubs are
[Sknderbeu](KF_Sknderbeu_Kor "wikilink"), [KF
Tirana](KF_Tirana "wikilink"), [Dinamo
Tirana](FK_Dinamo_Tirana "wikilink"),
[Partizani](FK_Partizani_Tirana "wikilink") and
[Vllaznia](KF_Vllaznia_Shkodr "wikilink").

Weightlifting is one of the most successful individual sport for the
Albanians, with the national team winning medals at the [European
Weightlifting
Championships](European_Weightlifting_Championships "wikilink") and the
rest international competitions. Albanian weightlifters have won a total
of 16 medals at the [European
Championships](European_Weightlifting_Championships "wikilink") with 1
of them being gold, 7 silver and 8 bronze. In the [World Weightlifting
Championships](World_Weightlifting_Championships "wikilink"), the
Albanian weightlifting team has won in
[1972](1972_World_Weightlifting_Championships "wikilink") a gold in
[2002](2002_World_Weightlifting_Championships "wikilink") a silver and
in [2011](2011_World_Weightlifting_Championships "wikilink") a bronze
medal.

### Diaspora

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Albanian diaspora|Category:Albanian diaspora|l2=Albanian communities}}
```
Historically, the Albanian people have established several communities
in many regions throughout Southern Europe. The [Albanian
diaspora](Albanian_diaspora "wikilink") has been formed since the late
[Middle Ages](Middle_Ages "wikilink"), when they emigrated to places
such as Italy, especially in [Sicily](Sicily "wikilink") and
[Calabria](Calabria "wikilink"), and [Greece](Greece "wikilink") to
escape either various socio-political difficulties or the [Ottoman
conquest](Ottoman_Empire "wikilink") of Albania.[^447] Following the
[fall of communism](Fall_of_communism_in_Albania "wikilink"), large
numbers of Albanians have migrated to countries such as Australia,
Canada, France, Germany, [Greece](Greece "wikilink"), Italy,
[Scandinavia](Scandinavia "wikilink"),
[Switzerland](Switzerland "wikilink"), the United Kingdom and the United
States. Albanian [minorities](Minority_group "wikilink") are present in
the neighbouring territories such as the west of [North
Macedonia](North_Macedonia "wikilink"), the east of
[Montenegro](Montenegro "wikilink"), [Kosovo](Kosovo "wikilink") in its
entirety and southern [Serbia](Serbia "wikilink"). In
[Kosovo](Kosovo "wikilink"), Albanians are the largest ethnic group in
the country. Altogether, the number of ethnic Albanians living abroad is
estimated to be higher than the total population inside Albania.

**New Zealand** (`{{lang-mi|[[Aotearoa]]}}`{=mediawiki}
`{{IPA-mi|ataa|}}`{=mediawiki}) is an [island
country](island_country "wikilink") in the southwestern [Pacific
Ocean](Pacific_Ocean "wikilink"). It consists of two main
landmasses---the [North Island](North_Island "wikilink")
(`{{lang|mi|Te Ika-a-Mui}}`{=mediawiki}) and the [South
Island](South_Island "wikilink")
(`{{lang|mi|Te Waipounamu}}`{=mediawiki})---and over 700 [smaller
islands](List_of_islands_of_New_Zealand "wikilink"). It is the
[sixth-largest island country](List_of_island_countries "wikilink") by
area and lies east of [Australia](Australia "wikilink") across the
[Tasman Sea](Tasman_Sea "wikilink") and south of the islands of [New
Caledonia](New_Caledonia "wikilink"), [Fiji](Fiji "wikilink"), and
[Tonga](Tonga "wikilink"). The [country\'s varied
topography](Geography_of_New_Zealand "wikilink") and sharp mountain
peaks, including the [Southern Alps](Southern_Alps "wikilink"), owe much
to [tectonic uplift](tectonic_uplift "wikilink") and volcanic eruptions.
New Zealand\'s [capital city](Capital_of_New_Zealand "wikilink") is
[Wellington](Wellington "wikilink"), and its most populous city is
[Auckland](Auckland "wikilink").

The islands of New Zealand were the last large habitable land to be
settled by humans. Between about 1280 and 1350,
[Polynesians](Polynesians "wikilink") began to settle in the islands and
then subsequently developed a distinctive [Mori
culture](Mori_culture "wikilink"). In 1642, the Dutch explorer [Abel
Tasman](Abel_Tasman "wikilink") became the first European to sight and
record New Zealand. In 1769 the British explorer [Captain James
Cook](James_Cook "wikilink") became the first European to set foot on
and map New Zealand. In 1840, representatives of the United Kingdom and
[Mori](Mori_people "wikilink") chiefs signed the [Treaty of
Waitangi](Treaty_of_Waitangi "wikilink"), which in its English version
declared British sovereignty over the islands. In 1841, New Zealand
[became a colony](Colony_of_New_Zealand "wikilink") within the [British
Empire](British_Empire "wikilink"). Subsequently, a [series of
conflicts](New_Zealand_Wars "wikilink") between the colonial government
and [Mori tribes](iwi "wikilink") resulted in the [alienation and
confiscation](New_Zealand_land_confiscations "wikilink") of large
amounts of Mori land. New Zealand [became a
dominion](Dominion_of_New_Zealand "wikilink") in 1907; it gained [full
statutory independence](Independence_of_New_Zealand "wikilink") in 1947,
retaining the monarch as [head of state](head_of_state "wikilink").
Today, the majority of [New Zealand\'s
population](New_Zealanders "wikilink") of 5.25 million is of [European
descent](European_New_Zealanders "wikilink"); the indigenous Mori are
the largest minority, followed by
[Asians](Asian_New_Zealanders "wikilink") and [Pacific
Islanders](Pacific_Islander "wikilink"). Reflecting this, [New
Zealand\'s culture](Culture_of_New_Zealand "wikilink") is mainly derived
from Mori and early British settlers, with recent broadening of culture
arising from increased
[immigration](Immigration_to_New_Zealand "wikilink"). The [official
languages](Languages_of_New_Zealand "wikilink") are English,
[Mori](Mori_language "wikilink"), and [New Zealand Sign
Language](New_Zealand_Sign_Language "wikilink"), with the [local dialect
of English](New_Zealand_English "wikilink") being dominant.

A [developed country](developed_country "wikilink"), it was the first to
introduce a [minimum wage](minimum_wage "wikilink"), and the first to
give [women the right to
vote](Women's_suffrage_in_New_Zealand "wikilink"). It [ranks very
highly](International_rankings_of_New_Zealand "wikilink") in
international measures of [quality of
life](Human_Development_Index "wikilink"), [human
rights](Human_rights_in_New_Zealand "wikilink"), and it has low levels
of [perceived corruption](corruption_perception_index "wikilink"). It
retains [visible levels of
inequality](Economic_inequality_in_New_Zealand "wikilink"), having
[structural
disparities](Structural_discrimination_in_New_Zealand "wikilink")
between its Mori and European populations. New Zealand underwent [major
economic changes](Rogernomics "wikilink") during the 1980s, which
transformed it from a [protectionist](Protectionism "wikilink") to a
[liberalised](Economic_liberalization "wikilink")
[free-trade](Free_trade "wikilink") economy. The service sector
dominates the [national economy](Economy_of_New_Zealand "wikilink"),
followed by the industrial sector, and
[agriculture](Agriculture_in_New_Zealand "wikilink"); international
[tourism](Tourism_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") is also a significant
source of revenue.

Nationally, legislative authority is vested in an elected,
[unicameral](Unicameralism "wikilink")
[Parliament](New_Zealand_Parliament "wikilink"), while executive
political power is exercised by the
[Government](New_Zealand_Government "wikilink"), led by the [prime
minister](Prime_Minister_of_New_Zealand "wikilink"), currently
[Christopher Luxon](Christopher_Luxon "wikilink"). [Charles
III](Charles_III "wikilink") is the [country\'s
king](Monarchy_of_New_Zealand "wikilink") and is represented by the
[governor-general](Governor-General_of_New_Zealand "wikilink"), [Cindy
Kiro](Cindy_Kiro "wikilink"). In addition, New Zealand is organised into
11 [regional councils](Regions_of_New_Zealand "wikilink") and 67
[territorial
authorities](Territorial_authorities_of_New_Zealand "wikilink") for
local government purposes. The [Realm of New
Zealand](Realm_of_New_Zealand "wikilink") also includes
[Tokelau](Tokelau "wikilink") (a [dependent
territory](dependent_territory "wikilink")); the [Cook
Islands](Cook_Islands "wikilink") and [Niue](Niue "wikilink")
(self-governing states in [free
association](Associated_state "wikilink") with New Zealand); and the
[Ross Dependency](Ross_Dependency "wikilink"), which is New Zealand\'s
[territorial claim in
Antarctica](Territorial_claims_in_Antarctica "wikilink").

New Zealand is a member of the [United
Nations](United_Nations "wikilink"), [Commonwealth of
Nations](Commonwealth_of_Nations "wikilink"), [ANZUS](ANZUS "wikilink"),
[UKUSA](UKUSA "wikilink"), [OECD](OECD "wikilink"), [ASEAN Plus
Six](ASEAN#ASEAN_Plus_Six "wikilink"), [Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation](Asia-Pacific_Economic_Cooperation "wikilink"), the [Pacific
Community](Pacific_Community "wikilink") and the [Pacific Islands
Forum](Pacific_Islands_Forum "wikilink"). It enjoys [particularly close
relations](New_ZealandUnited_States_relations "wikilink") with the
[United States](United_States "wikilink") and is one of its [major
non-NATO allies](Major_non-NATO_ally "wikilink");[^1] the [United
Kingdom](United_Kingdom "wikilink"); and [with
Australia](AustraliaNew_Zealand_relations "wikilink"), with a shared
\"[Trans-Tasman](Trans-Tasman "wikilink")\" identity between the two
countries.[^2] `{{TOC limit|3}}`{=mediawiki}

![Detail from a 1657 map showing the western coastline of
`{{lang|la|Nova Zeelandia}}`{=mediawiki} (On this map, north is at the
bottom.)\|alt=Brown square paper with Dutch writing and a thick red,
curved
line](Detail_of_1657_map_Polus_Antarcticus_by_Jan_Janssonius,_showing_Nova_Zeelandia.png "Detail from a 1657 map showing the western coastline of  (On this map, north is at the bottom.)|alt=Brown square paper with Dutch writing and a thick red, curved line")
The first European visitor to New Zealand, Dutch explorer [Abel
Tasman](Abel_Tasman "wikilink"), named the islands *Staten Land*,
believing they were part of the
`{{lang|nl|[[Isla de los Estados|Staten Landt]]}}`{=mediawiki} that
[Jacob Le Maire](Jacob_Le_Maire "wikilink") had sighted off the southern
end of South America.[^3][^4] [Hendrik
Brouwer](Hendrik_Brouwer "wikilink") proved that the South American land
was a small island in 1643, and Dutch
[cartographers](cartographers "wikilink") subsequently renamed Tasman\'s
discovery `{{lang|la|Nova Zeelandia}}`{=mediawiki} from
[Latin](Neo-Latin "wikilink"), after the [Dutch
province](Seventeen_Provinces "wikilink") of
[Zeeland](Zeeland "wikilink").[^5][^6] This name was later
[anglicised](Anglicisation "wikilink") to *New Zealand*.[^7][^8]

This was written as *Nu Tireni* in the [Mori
language](Mori_language "wikilink") (spelled *Nu Tirani* in Te Tiriti o
Waitangi). In 1834 a document written in Mori and entitled
\"`{{lang|mi|He Wakaputanga o te Rangatiratanga o Nu Tireni}}`{=mediawiki}\"
was translated into English and became the [Declaration of the
Independence of New
Zealand](Declaration_of_the_Independence_of_New_Zealand "wikilink"). It
was prepared by
`{{lang|mi|Te W(h)akaminenga o Nga Rangatiratanga o Nga Hapu o Nu Tireni}}`{=mediawiki},
the [United Tribes of New
Zealand](United_Tribes_of_New_Zealand "wikilink"), and a copy was sent
to King [William IV](William_IV "wikilink") who had already acknowledged
the flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand, and who recognised the
declaration in a letter from [Lord
Glenelg](Charles_Grant,_1st_Baron_Glenelg "wikilink").[^9]`{{sfn|Palmer|2008|p=41}}`{=mediawiki}

```{=mediawiki}
{{lang|mi|[[Aotearoa]]}}
```
(pronounced `{{IPA-mi|ataa|}}`{=mediawiki} in Mori and
`{{IPAc-en||a|t|r|o|.|}}`{=mediawiki} in English; often
translated as \'land of the long white
cloud\')`{{sfn|King|2003|p=41}}`{=mediawiki} is the current Mori name
for New Zealand. It is unknown whether Mori had a name for the whole
country before the arrival of Europeans;
`{{lang|mi|Aotearoa}}`{=mediawiki} originally referred to just the
[North
Island](North_Island "wikilink").`{{sfn|Hay|Maclagan|Gordon|2008|p=72}}`{=mediawiki}
Mori had several traditional names for the two main islands, including
`{{lang|mi|Te Ika-a-Mui}}`{=mediawiki} (\"the fish of
`{{lang|mi|italic=no|[[Mui (Mori mythology)|Mui]]}}`{=mediawiki}\")
for the North Island and `{{lang|mi|Te Waipounamu}}`{=mediawiki} (\"the
waters of [greenstone](Pounamu "wikilink")\") or
`{{lang|mi|Te Waka o Aoraki}}`{=mediawiki} (\"the canoe of
`{{lang|mi|italic=no|[[Aoraki]]}}`{=mediawiki}\") for the [South
Island](South_Island "wikilink").`{{sfn|Mein Smith|2005|p=6}}`{=mediawiki}
Early European maps labelled the islands North (North Island), Middle
(South Island), and South ([Stewart Island /
`{{lang|mi|italic=no|nocat=y|Rakiura}}`{=mediawiki}](Stewart_Island_/_Rakiura "wikilink")).[^10]
In 1830, mapmakers began to use \"North\" and \"South\" on their maps to
distinguish the two largest islands, and by 1907, this was the accepted
norm.[^11] The [New Zealand Geographic
Board](New_Zealand_Geographic_Board "wikilink") discovered in 2009 that
the names of the North Island and South Island had never been
formalised, and names and alternative names were formalised in 2013.
This set the names as *North Island* or
`{{lang|mi|Te Ika-a-Mui}}`{=mediawiki}, and *South Island* or
`{{lang|mi|Te Waipounamu}}`{=mediawiki}.[^12] For each island, either
its English or Mori name can be used, or both can be used
together.[^13] Similarly the Mori and English names for the whole
country are sometimes used together (*Aotearoa New Zealand*);[^14][^15]
however, this has no official recognition.[^16]

In [Moriori](Moriori_language "wikilink"), the indigenous language of
the [Chatham Islands](Chatham_Islands "wikilink"), the words *Aote* and
*Aotea* are terms thought to refer to mainland New Zealand.[^17][^18]

[right\|thumb\|upright=1.3\|The [Mori people](Mori_people "wikilink")
descend from [Polynesians](Polynesians "wikilink") whose ancestors
emigrated from [Taiwan](Taiwan "wikilink") to
[Melanesia](Melanesia "wikilink") between 3000 and
1000 [BCE](Common_Era "wikilink") and then travelled east, reaching the
[Society Islands](Society_Islands "wikilink")
`{{circa|1000 CE}}`{=mediawiki}. After a pause of 200 to 300 years, a
new wave of exploration led to the discovery and settlement of New
Zealand.[^19][^20][^21] \|alt=One set of arrows point from Taiwan to
Melanesia to Fiji/Samoa and then to the Marquesas Islands. The
population then spread, some going south to New Zealand and others going
north to [Hawai\'i](Hawai'i "wikilink"). A second set start in southern
Asia and end in
[Melanesia](Melanesia "wikilink").New](File:Polynesian_Migration.svg "wikilink")
Zealand was the last major landmass settled by humans. The story of
[Kupe](Kupe "wikilink") as the first human to set foot on the New
Zealand archipelago, accredited to by most Mori iwi, is considered
credible by historians; he is generally believed to have existed
historically.[^22] Most histories claim that this occurred approximately
40 generations ago (between 900 and 1200 AD).[^23] The more specific
reasons for Kupe\'s semi-legendary journey, and the migration of Mori
in general, are contested. It is thought by some historians that
[Hawaiki](Hawaiki "wikilink") and other Polynesian islands were
experiencing considerable internal conflict at that time, which is
thought to have caused an exodus from them. Some historians contend that
this was because of the fallout from the [1257 Samalas
eruption](1257_Samalas_eruption "wikilink"), which caused crop
devastation globally and possibly helped trigger the [Little Ice
Age](Little_Ice_Age "wikilink").[^24][^25]

[Radiocarbon dating](Radiocarbon_dating "wikilink"), evidence of
[deforestation](deforestation "wikilink")[^26] and [mitochondrial
DNA](mitochondrial_DNA "wikilink") variability within
[Mori](Mori_people "wikilink") populations[^27] suggest that Eastern
[Polynesians](Polynesians "wikilink") first settled the New Zealand
archipelago between 1250 and
1300,`{{sfn|Mein Smith|2005|p= 6}}`{=mediawiki}[^28] although newer
[archaeological](Archaeology_of_New_Zealand "wikilink") and genetic
research points to a date no earlier than about 1280, with at least the
main settlement period between about 1320 and 1350,[^29][^30] consistent
with evidence based on [genealogical
traditions](Whakapapa "wikilink").[^31][^32] This represented a
culmination in a long series of voyages through the Pacific
islands.[^33] It is the broad consensus of historians that the
settlement of New Zealand by [Eastern
Polynesians](Polynesian_people "wikilink") was planned and
deliberate.[^34] Over the centuries that followed, the Polynesian
settlers developed a distinct culture now known as Mori. The population
formed different `{{lang|mi|[[iwi]]|italics=no}}`{=mediawiki} (tribes)
and `{{lang|mi|[[hap]]|italics=no}}`{=mediawiki} (subtribes) which
would sometimes cooperate, sometimes compete and sometimes fight against
each other.[^35] At some point, a group of Mori migrated to
`{{lang|mi|Rkohu}}`{=mediawiki}, now known as the [Chatham
Islands](Chatham_Islands "wikilink"), where they developed their
distinct [Moriori](Moriori "wikilink") culture.[^36][^37] The Moriori
population was all but wiped out between 1835 and 1862 in the [Moriori
genocide](Moriori_genocide "wikilink"), largely because of
[Taranaki](Taranaki_(iwi) "wikilink") Mori invasion and enslavement in
the 1830s, although European diseases also contributed. In 1862, only
101 survived, and the last known full-blooded Moriori died in 1933.[^38]

In a hostile 1642 encounter between [Ngti
Tmatakkiri](Ngti_Tmatakkiri "wikilink") and Dutch explorer [Abel
Tasman](Abel_Tasman "wikilink")\'s
crew,[^39]`{{sfn|Mein Smith|2005|p=23}}`{=mediawiki} four of Tasman\'s
crew members were killed, and at least one Mori was hit by [canister
shot](canister_shot "wikilink").[^40] Europeans did not revisit New
Zealand until 1769, when British explorer [James
Cook](James_Cook "wikilink") mapped almost the entire
coastline.`{{sfn|Mein Smith|2005|p=23}}`{=mediawiki} Following Cook, New
Zealand was visited by numerous European and [North
American](North_America "wikilink")
[whaling](History_of_whaling "wikilink"),
[sealing](Seal_hunting "wikilink"), and trading ships. They traded
European food, metal tools, weapons, and other goods for timber, Mori
food, artefacts, and water.`{{sfn|King|2003|p=122}}`{=mediawiki} The
introduction of the potato and the [musket](musket "wikilink")
transformed Mori agriculture and warfare. Potatoes provided a reliable
food surplus, which enabled longer and more sustained military
campaigns.[^41] The resulting intertribal [Musket
Wars](Musket_Wars "wikilink") encompassed over 600 battles between 1801
and 1840, killing 30,000--40,000 Mori.[^42] From the early 19th
century, Christian [missionaries](Missionary "wikilink") began to settle
New Zealand, eventually [converting](Religious_conversion "wikilink")
most of the Mori population.[^43] The Mori population declined to
around 40% of its pre-contact level during the 19th century; introduced
diseases were the major factor.[^44]

The [British Government](Resident_minister "wikilink") appointed [James
Busby](James_Busby "wikilink") as British Resident to New Zealand in
1832.[^45] His duties, given to him by Governor Bourke in Sydney, were
to protect settlers and traders \"of good standing\", prevent
\"outrages\" against Mori, and apprehend escaped convicts.[^46][^47] In
1835, following an announcement of impending French settlement by
[Charles de Thierry](Charles_de_Thierry "wikilink"), the nebulous
[United Tribes of New Zealand](United_Tribes_of_New_Zealand "wikilink")
sent a [Declaration of
Independence](Declaration_of_the_Independence_of_New_Zealand "wikilink")
to King [William IV of the United
Kingdom](William_IV_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") asking for
protection.[^48] Ongoing unrest, the proposed settlement of New Zealand
by the [New Zealand Company](New_Zealand_Company "wikilink") (which had
already sent its first ship of surveyors to buy land from Mori) and the
dubious legal standing of the Declaration of Independence prompted the
[Colonial Office](Colonial_Office "wikilink") to send Captain [William
Hobson](William_Hobson "wikilink") to claim sovereignty for the [United
Kingdom](United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland "wikilink") and
negotiate a treaty with the Mori.[^49] The [Treaty of
Waitangi](Treaty_of_Waitangi "wikilink") was first signed in the [Bay of
Islands](Bay_of_Islands "wikilink") on 6 February 1840.[^50] In response
to the New Zealand Company\'s attempts to establish an independent
settlement in [Wellington](Wellington "wikilink"),[^51][^52] Hobson
declared British sovereignty over all of New Zealand on 21 May 1840,
even though copies of the treaty were still circulating throughout the
country for Mori to sign.[^53] With the signing of the treaty and
declaration of sovereignty, the number of immigrants, particularly from
the United Kingdom, began to increase.[^54]

New Zealand was administered as a dependency of the [Colony of New South
Wales](Colony_of_New_South_Wales "wikilink") until becoming a separate
[Crown colony](Crown_colony "wikilink"), the [Colony of New
Zealand](Colony_of_New_Zealand "wikilink"), on 3 May 1841.[^55][^56]
Armed conflict began between the colonial government and Mori in 1843
with the [Wairau Affray](Wairau_Affray "wikilink") over land and
disagreements over sovereignty. These conflicts, mainly in the North
Island, saw thousands of imperial troops and the Royal Navy come to New
Zealand and became known as the [New Zealand
Wars](New_Zealand_Wars "wikilink"). Following these armed conflicts,
large areas of [Mori land were confiscated by the
government](New_Zealand_land_confiscations "wikilink") to meet settler
demands.[^57]

people](File:1863_Meeting_of_Settlers_and_Maoris_at_Hawke's_Bay,_New_Zealand.jpg "wikilink")

The colony gained a [representative government in
1852](New_Zealand_Constitution_Act_1852 "wikilink"), and the [first
Parliament](1st_New_Zealand_Parliament "wikilink") met in 1854.[^58] In
1856 the colony effectively became self-governing, gaining
responsibility over all domestic matters (except
[native](Indigenous_peoples "wikilink") policy, which was granted in the
mid-1860s).[^59] Following concerns that the South Island might form a
separate colony, premier [Alfred Domett](Alfred_Domett "wikilink") moved
a resolution to transfer the
[capital](Capital_of_New_Zealand "wikilink") from Auckland to a locality
near [Cook Strait](Cook_Strait "wikilink").[^60][^61] Wellington was
chosen for its central location, with Parliament officially sitting
there for the first time in 1865.[^62]

In 1886, New Zealand annexed the volcanic [Kermadec
Islands](Kermadec_Islands "wikilink"), about
`{{cvt|1000|km}}`{=mediawiki} northeast of Auckland. Since 1937, the
islands are uninhabited except for about six people at [Raoul
Island](Raoul_Island "wikilink") station. These islands put the northern
border of New Zealand at 29 degrees South latitude.[^63] After the 1982
[UNCLOS](UNCLOS "wikilink"), the islands contributed significantly to
New Zealand\'s [exclusive economic
zone](Exclusive_economic_zone_of_New_Zealand "wikilink").[^64]

In 1891 the [Liberal Party](New_Zealand_Liberal_Party "wikilink") came
to power as the first organised political party.[^65] The [Liberal
Government](Liberal_Government_of_New_Zealand "wikilink"), led by
[Richard Seddon](Richard_Seddon "wikilink") for most of its period in
office,[^66] passed many important social and economic measures. In 1893
New Zealand was the first nation in the world to grant all [women the
right to vote](Women's_suffrage_in_New_Zealand "wikilink")[^67] and in
1894 pioneered the [adoption of compulsory
arbitration](Industrial_Conciliation_and_Arbitration_Act_1894 "wikilink")
between employers and unions.[^68] The Liberals also guaranteed a
minimum wage in 1894, a world first.[^69]

In 1907, at the request of the New Zealand Parliament, King [Edward
VII](Edward_VII "wikilink") proclaimed New Zealand a
[Dominion](Dominion_of_New_Zealand "wikilink") within the [British
Empire](British_Empire "wikilink"),[^70] reflecting its self-governing
status.[^71] In 1947, New Zealand
[adopted](Statute_of_Westminster_Adoption_Act_1947 "wikilink") the
[Statute of Westminster](Statute_of_Westminster_1931 "wikilink"),
confirming that the [British Parliament](British_Parliament "wikilink")
could no longer legislate for the country without its consent. The
British government\'s residual legislative powers were later removed by
the [Constitution Act 1986](Constitution_Act_1986 "wikilink"), and final
rights of appeal to British courts were abolished in 2003.[^72]

Early in the 20th century, New Zealand was involved in world affairs,
fighting in the
[First](Military_history_of_New_Zealand_during_World_War_I "wikilink")
and [Second World
Wars](Military_history_of_New_Zealand_during_World_War_II "wikilink")[^73]
and suffering through the [Great
Depression](Great_Depression "wikilink").[^74] The depression led to the
election of the [first Labour
Government](First_Labour_Government_of_New_Zealand "wikilink") and the
establishment of a comprehensive [welfare
state](welfare_state "wikilink") and a
[protectionist](protectionist "wikilink") economy.[^75] New Zealand
experienced increasing prosperity following the Second World War,[^76]
and Mori began to leave their traditional rural life and move to the
cities in search of work.[^77] A [Mori protest
movement](Mori_protest_movement "wikilink") developed, which criticised
[Eurocentrism](Eurocentrism "wikilink") and worked for greater
recognition of [Mori culture](Mori_culture "wikilink") and of the
Treaty of Waitangi.[^78] In 1975, a [Waitangi
Tribunal](Waitangi_Tribunal "wikilink") was set up to investigate
alleged breaches of the Treaty, and it was enabled to investigate
historic grievances in 1985.[^79] The government has negotiated
[settlements of these
grievances](Treaty_of_Waitangi_claims_and_settlements "wikilink") with
many iwi,[^80] although [Mori claims to the foreshore and
seabed](New_Zealand_foreshore_and_seabed_controversy "wikilink") proved
controversial in the 2000s.[^81][^82]

New Zealand is a [constitutional
monarchy](constitutional_monarchy "wikilink") with a [parliamentary
democracy](parliamentary_democracy "wikilink"),[^83] although [its
constitution](Constitution_of_New_Zealand "wikilink") is [not
codified](Uncodified_constitution "wikilink").[^84] [Charles
III](Charles_III "wikilink") is the [king of New
Zealand](king_of_New_Zealand "wikilink")[^85] and thus the [head of
state](head_of_state "wikilink").[^86] The king is represented by the
[governor-general](Governor-General_of_New_Zealand "wikilink"), whom he
appoints on the [advice](Advice_(constitutional) "wikilink") of the
[prime minister](Prime_Minister_of_New_Zealand "wikilink").[^87] The
governor-general can exercise [the Crown](the_Crown "wikilink")\'s
[prerogative powers](prerogative_powers "wikilink"), such as reviewing
cases of injustice and making appointments of
[ministers](Ministers_in_the_New_Zealand_Government "wikilink"),
ambassadors, and other key public officials,[^88] and in rare
situations, the [reserve powers](reserve_power "wikilink") (e.g. the
power to dissolve Parliament or refuse the [royal
assent](royal_assent "wikilink") of a [bill](bill_(law) "wikilink") into
law).[^89] The powers of the monarch and the governor-general are
limited by constitutional constraints, and they cannot normally be
exercised without the advice of ministers.[^90]

The [New Zealand Parliament](New_Zealand_Parliament "wikilink") holds
[legislative power](legislative_power "wikilink") and consists of the
king and the [House of
Representatives](New_Zealand_House_of_Representatives "wikilink").[^91]
It also included an upper house, the [Legislative
Council](New_Zealand_Legislative_Council "wikilink"), until this was
abolished in 1950.[^92] The [supremacy of
parliament](supremacy_of_parliament "wikilink") over the Crown and other
government institutions was established in England by the [Bill of
Rights 1689](Bill_of_Rights_1689 "wikilink") and has been ratified as
law in New Zealand.[^93] The House of Representatives is democratically
elected, and a government is formed from the party or
[coalition](Coalition_government "wikilink") with the majority of seats.
If no majority is formed, a [minority
government](minority_government "wikilink") can be formed if support
from other parties during [confidence and
supply](confidence_and_supply "wikilink") votes is assured.[^94] The
governor-general appoints ministers under advice from the prime
minister, who is by
[convention](Constitutional_convention_(political_custom) "wikilink")
the [parliamentary leader](parliamentary_leader "wikilink") of the
governing party or coalition.[^95]
[Cabinet](Cabinet_of_New_Zealand "wikilink"), formed by ministers and
led by the prime minister, is the highest policy-making body in
government and responsible for deciding significant government
actions.[^96] Members of Cabinet make major decisions collectively and
are therefore [collectively
responsible](Cabinet_collective_responsibility "wikilink") for the
consequences of these decisions.[^97] The 42nd and current prime
minister, since 27 November 2023, is [Christopher
Luxon](Christopher_Luxon "wikilink").[^98] ![A statue of [Richard
Seddon](Richard_Seddon "wikilink"), the

A [parliamentary general election](Elections_in_New_Zealand "wikilink")
must be called no later than three years after the previous
election.[^99] Almost all general elections between
`{{NZ election link year|1853}}`{=mediawiki} and
`{{NZ election link year|1993}}`{=mediawiki} were held under the
[first-past-the-post voting](first-past-the-post_voting "wikilink")
system.[^100] Since the `{{NZ election link|1996}}`{=mediawiki}, a form
of [proportional representation](proportional_representation "wikilink")
called [mixed-member proportional](mixed-member_proportional "wikilink")
(MMP) has been used.[^101] Under the MMP system, each person has two
votes; one is for a candidate standing in the voter\'s
[electorate](New_Zealand_electorates "wikilink"), and the other is for a
party. Based on the 2018 census data, there are 72 electorates (which
include seven [Mori electorates](Mori_electorates "wikilink") in which
only Mori can optionally vote),[^102] and the remaining 48 of the 120
seats are assigned so that representation in Parliament reflects the
party vote, with the threshold that a party must win at least one
electorate or 5% of the total party vote before it is eligible for a
seat.[^103] Elections since the 1930s have been dominated by two
[political
parties](List_of_political_parties_in_New_Zealand "wikilink"),
[National](New_Zealand_National_Party "wikilink") and
[Labour](New_Zealand_Labour_Party "wikilink"). More parties have been
represented in Parliament since the introduction of MMP.[^104]

[New Zealand\'s judiciary](Judiciary_of_New_Zealand "wikilink"), headed
by the [chief justice](Chief_Justice_of_New_Zealand "wikilink"),[^105]
includes the [Supreme Court](Supreme_Court_of_New_Zealand "wikilink"),
[Court of Appeal](Court_of_Appeal_of_New_Zealand "wikilink"), the [High
Court](High_Court_of_New_Zealand "wikilink"), and subordinate
courts.[^106] Judges and judicial officers are appointed non-politically
and under strict rules regarding tenure to help maintain [judicial
independence](judicial_independence "wikilink").[^107] This
theoretically allows the judiciary to interpret the law based solely on
the legislation enacted by Parliament without other influences on their
decisions.[^108]

New Zealand is identified as one of the world\'s most stable and
well-governed states.[^109] `{{As of|2017|post=,}}`{=mediawiki} the
country was ranked fourth in the strength of its democratic
institutions,[^110] and first in government transparency and [lack of
corruption](Corruption_in_New_Zealand "wikilink").[^111] [LGBT
rights](LGBT_rights_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") in the nation are also
recognised as among the most tolerant in
[Oceania](Oceania "wikilink").[^112] New Zealand ranks highly for civic
participation in the political process, with 82% [voter
turnout](voter_turnout "wikilink") during recent general elections,
compared to an [OECD](OECD "wikilink") average of 69%.[^113] However,
this is untrue for local council elections; a historically low 36% of
eligible New Zealanders voted in the [2022 local
elections](2022_New_Zealand_local_elections "wikilink"), compared with
an already low 42% turnout in
[2019](2019_New_Zealand_local_elections "wikilink").[^114][^115][^116] A
2017 [human rights
report](Country_Reports_on_Human_Rights_Practices "wikilink") by the
[United States Department of
State](United_States_Department_of_State "wikilink") noted that the New
Zealand government generally [respected the
rights](Human_rights_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") of individuals, but
voiced concerns regarding the social status of the Mori
population.[^117] In terms of [structural
discrimination](Structural_discrimination_in_New_Zealand "wikilink"),
the [New Zealand Human Rights
Commission](Human_Rights_Commission "wikilink") has asserted that there
is strong, consistent evidence that it is a real and ongoing
socioeconomic issue.[^118] One example of structural inequality in New
Zealand can be seen in the criminal justice system. According to the
[Ministry of Justice](Ministry_of_Justice_(New_Zealand) "wikilink"),
Mori are overrepresented, comprising 45% of New Zealanders convicted of
crimes and 53% of those imprisoned, while only being 16.5% of the
population.[^119][^120]

During the period of the New Zealand colony, Britain was responsible for
external trade and foreign relations.[^121] The 1923 and 1926 [Imperial
Conferences](Imperial_Conference "wikilink") decided that New Zealand
should be allowed to negotiate its own political
[treaties](treaties "wikilink"), and the first commercial treaty was
ratified in 1928 with Japan. On 3 September 1939, New Zealand allied
itself with Britain and [declared war](Declaration_of_war "wikilink") on
Germany with Prime Minister [Michael Joseph
Savage](Michael_Joseph_Savage "wikilink") proclaiming, \"Where she goes,
we go; where she stands, we stand\".[^122]![[Mori

In 1951, the United Kingdom became increasingly focused on its European
interests,[^123] while New Zealand joined
[Australia](AustraliaNew_Zealand_relations "wikilink") and the [United
States](New_ZealandUnited_States_relations "wikilink") in the
[ANZUS](ANZUS "wikilink") security treaty.[^124] The influence of the
United States on New Zealand weakened following protests over the
[Vietnam War](New_Zealand_in_the_Vietnam_War "wikilink"),[^125] the
refusal of the United States to admonish France after the [sinking of
the *Rainbow Warrior*](sinking_of_the_Rainbow_Warrior "wikilink"),[^126]
disagreements over environmental and agricultural trade issues, and [New
Zealand\'s nuclear-free
policy](New_Zealand_nuclear-free_zone "wikilink").[^127][^128] Despite
the United States\'s suspension of ANZUS obligations, the treaty
remained in effect between New Zealand and Australia, whose foreign
policy has followed a similar historical trend.[^129] Close political
contact is maintained between the two countries, with [free trade
agreements](Closer_Economic_Relations "wikilink") and [travel
arrangements](Trans-Tasman_Travel_Arrangement "wikilink") that allow
citizens to visit, live and work in both countries without
restrictions.[^130] `{{As of|2013|alt=In 2013}}`{=mediawiki} there were
about 650,000 New Zealand citizens living in Australia, which is
equivalent to 15% of the population of New Zealand.[^131]

New Zealand has a strong presence among the [Pacific
Island](Pacific_Island "wikilink") countries.[^132] A large proportion
of New Zealand\'s aid goes to these countries, and many Pacific people
migrate to New Zealand for employment.[^133] Permanent migration is
regulated under the 1970 Samoan Quota Scheme and the 2002 Pacific Access
Category, which allow up to 1,100 Samoan nationals and up to 750 other
Pacific Islanders respectively to become permanent New Zealand residents
each year. A seasonal workers scheme for temporary migration was
introduced in 2007, and in 2009 about 8,000 Pacific Islanders were
employed under it.[^134] New Zealand is involved in the [Pacific Islands
Forum](Pacific_Islands_Forum "wikilink"), the [Pacific
Community](Pacific_Community "wikilink"), [Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation](Asia-Pacific_Economic_Cooperation "wikilink"), and the
[Association of Southeast Asian
Nations](Association_of_Southeast_Asian_Nations "wikilink") Regional
Forum (including the [East Asia
Summit](East_Asia_Summit "wikilink")).[^135] New Zealand has been
described as a [middle power](middle_power "wikilink") in the
[Asia-Pacific](Asia-Pacific "wikilink") region,[^136] and an [emerging
power](emerging_power "wikilink").[^137][^138] The country is a member
of the [United
Nations](New_Zealand_and_the_United_Nations "wikilink"),[^139] the
[Commonwealth of Nations](Commonwealth_of_Nations "wikilink")[^140] and
the [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and

[national defence](national_defence "wikilink") needs are modest since a
direct attack is unlikely.[^144] However, its military has [had a global
presence](Military_history_of_New_Zealand "wikilink"). The country
fought in both world wars, with notable campaigns in
[Gallipoli](Gallipoli_Campaign "wikilink"),
[Crete](Battle_of_Crete "wikilink"),[^145] [El
Alamein](Second_Battle_of_El_Alamein "wikilink"),[^146] and
[Cassino](Battle_of_Monte_Cassino "wikilink").[^147] The Gallipoli
campaign played an important part in fostering New Zealand\'s [national
identity](national_identity "wikilink")[^148][^149] and strengthened the
[ANZAC](Australian_and_New_Zealand_Army_Corps "wikilink") tradition it
shares with Australia.[^150]

In addition to Vietnam and the two world wars, New Zealand fought in the
[Second Boer War](Second_Boer_War "wikilink"),[^151] the [Korean
War](New_Zealand_in_the_Korean_War "wikilink"),[^152] the [Malayan
Emergency](Malayan_Emergency "wikilink"),[^153] the [Gulf
War](Gulf_War "wikilink"), and the [Afghanistan
War](War_in_Afghanistan_(2001present) "wikilink"). It has contributed
forces to several regional and global peacekeeping missions, such as
those in [Cyprus](Cyprus_dispute "wikilink"),
[Somalia](Somali_Civil_War "wikilink"), [Bosnia and

Today, New Zealand enjoys [particularly close
relations](New_ZealandUnited_States_relations "wikilink") with the
[United States](United_States "wikilink") and is one of its [major
non-NATO allies](Major_non-NATO_ally "wikilink"),[^155] as [well as with
Australia](AustraliaNew_Zealand_relations "wikilink"), with a
\"[Trans-Tasman](Trans-Tasman "wikilink")\" identity between citizens of
the latter being common.[^156] New Zealand is a member of the [Five
Eyes](Five_Eyes "wikilink") intelligence sharing agreement, known
formally as the [UKUSA Agreement](UKUSA_Agreement "wikilink"). The five
members of this agreement compromise the [core
Anglosphere](Anglosphere "wikilink"): Australia, Canada, New Zealand,
the United Kingdom, and the United States.[^157] Since 2012, New Zealand
has had a partnership arrangement with
[NATO](North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization "wikilink") under the
Partnership Interoperability Initiative.[^158][^159][^160]

### Local government and external territories {#local_government_and_external_territories}

![Map of regions (coloured) and territorial authorities (outlined) in
New Zealand\|alt=A map of New Zealand divided into regions and
territorial authorities with
labels](NZ_Regional_Councils_and_Territorial_Authorities_2017.svg "Map of regions (coloured) and territorial authorities (outlined) in New Zealand|alt=A map of New Zealand divided into regions and territorial authorities with labels")
The early European settlers divided New Zealand into
[provinces](Provinces_of_New_Zealand "wikilink"), which had a degree of
autonomy.[^161] Because of financial pressures and the desire to
consolidate railways, education, land sales, and other policies,
government was centralised and the provinces were abolished in
1876.[^162] The provinces are remembered in [regional public
holidays](Public_holidays_in_New_Zealand "wikilink")[^163] and sporting
rivalries.[^164]

Since 1876, various councils have administered local areas under
legislation determined by the central government.[^165][^166] In 1989,
the government reorganised local government into the current two-tier
structure of [regional councils](Regions_of_New_Zealand "wikilink") and
[territorial authorities](territorial_authorities "wikilink").[^167] The
[249
municipalities](List_of_former_territorial_authorities_in_New_Zealand "wikilink")[^168]
that existed in 1975 have now been consolidated into 67 territorial
authorities and 11 regional councils.[^169] The regional councils\' role
is to regulate \"the natural environment with particular emphasis on
[resource management](Resource_Management_Act_1991 "wikilink")\",[^170]
while territorial authorities are responsible for sewage, water, local
roads, building consents, and other local
matters.`{{sfn|Smelt|Jui Lin|2009|p=33}}`{=mediawiki}[^171] Five of the
territorial councils are [unitary
authorities](Unitary_authority "wikilink") and also act as regional
councils.[^172] The territorial authorities consist of 13 city councils,
53 [district](Districts_of_New_Zealand "wikilink") councils, and the
[Chatham Islands](Chatham_Islands "wikilink") Council. While officially
the Chatham Islands Council is not a unitary authority, it undertakes
many functions of a regional council.[^173]

The Realm of New Zealand, one of 15 [Commonwealth
realms](Commonwealth_realm "wikilink"),[^174] is the entire area over
which the king or queen of New Zealand is
[sovereign](sovereign "wikilink") and comprises New Zealand,
[Tokelau](Tokelau "wikilink"), the [Ross
Dependency](Ross_Dependency "wikilink"), the [Cook
Islands](Cook_Islands "wikilink"), and [Niue](Niue "wikilink").[^175]
The Cook Islands and Niue are self-governing states in [free
association](Associated_state "wikilink") with New Zealand.[^176][^177]
The New Zealand Parliament cannot pass legislation for these countries,
but with their consent can act on behalf of them in foreign affairs and
defence. Tokelau is classified as a [non-self-governing
territory](United_Nations_list_of_non-self-governing_territories "wikilink"),
but is administered by a council of three elders (one from each
Tokelauan [atoll](atoll "wikilink")).[^178] The Ross Dependency is New
Zealand\'s [territorial claim in
Antarctica](Territorial_claims_in_Antarctica "wikilink"), where it
operates the [Scott Base](Scott_Base "wikilink") research
facility.[^179] [New Zealand nationality
law](New_Zealand_nationality_law "wikilink") treats all parts of the
realm equally, so most people born in New Zealand, the Cook Islands,
Niue, Tokelau, and the Ross Dependency are New Zealand
citizens.[^180]`{{Refn|A person born on or after 1 January 2006 acquires New Zealand citizenship at birth only if at least one parent is a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident.

## Geography and environment {#geography_and_environment}

{{Main|Geography of New Zealand|Environment of New Zealand}}
```
![The snow-capped [Southern Alps](Southern_Alps "wikilink") dominate the
South Island, while the North Island\'s [Northland
Peninsula](Northland_Peninsula "wikilink") stretches towards the
subtropics.\|alt=Islands of New Zealand as seen from
satellite](New_Zealand_23_October_2002.jpg "The snow-capped Southern Alps dominate the South Island, while the North Island's Northland Peninsula stretches towards the subtropics.|alt=Islands of New Zealand as seen from satellite")

New Zealand is located near the centre of the [water
hemisphere](water_hemisphere "wikilink") and is made up of two main
islands and more than 700 [smaller
islands](List_of_islands_of_New_Zealand "wikilink").[^181] The two main
islands (the [North Island](North_Island "wikilink"), or
`{{lang|mi|Te Ika-a-Mui}}`{=mediawiki}, and the [South
Island](South_Island "wikilink"), or
`{{lang|mi|Te Waipounamu}}`{=mediawiki}) are separated by [Cook
Strait](Cook_Strait "wikilink"), `{{convert|22|km|mi}}`{=mediawiki} wide
at its narrowest point.[^182] Besides the North and South Islands, the
five largest inhabited islands are [Stewart
Island](Stewart_Island "wikilink") (across the [Foveaux
Strait](Foveaux_Strait "wikilink")), [Chatham
Island](Chatham_Island "wikilink"), [Great Barrier
Island](Great_Barrier_Island "wikilink") (in the [Hauraki
Gulf](Hauraki_Gulf "wikilink")),[^183] [D\'Urville
Island](D'Urville_Island_(New_Zealand) "wikilink") (in the [Marlborough
Sounds](Marlborough_Sounds "wikilink"))[^184] and [Waiheke
Island](Waiheke_Island "wikilink") (about
`{{convert|22|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}`{=mediawiki} from central
Auckland).[^185]

New Zealand is long and narrow---over
`{{convert|1600|km|mi}}`{=mediawiki} along its north-north-east axis
with a maximum width of `{{convert|400|km|mi}}`{=mediawiki}[^186]---with
about `{{convert|15000|km|mi|-2|abbr=on}}`{=mediawiki} of
coastline[^187] and a total land area of
`{{convert|268000|km2|-2}}`{=mediawiki}.[^188] Because of its far-flung
outlying islands and long coastline, the country has extensive marine
resources. Its [exclusive economic
zone](Exclusive_economic_zone_of_New_Zealand "wikilink") is one of the
largest in the world, covering more than 15 times its land area.[^189]

```
The South Island is the largest landmass of New Zealand. It is divided
along its length by the [Southern Alps](Southern_Alps "wikilink").[^190]
There are 18 peaks over `{{convert|3000|m|ft}}`{=mediawiki}, the highest
of which is [`{{lang|mi|nocat=yes|italic=no|Aoraki}}`{=mediawiki} /
Mount Cook](Aoraki_/_Mount_Cook "wikilink") at
`{{convert|3724|m|ft}}`{=mediawiki}.`{{sfn|Garden|2005|p=52}}`{=mediawiki}
[Fiordland](Fiordland "wikilink")\'s steep mountains and deep
[fiords](List_of_fiords_of_New_Zealand "wikilink") record the extensive
ice age glaciation of this southwestern corner of the South
Island.[^191] The North Island is less mountainous but is [marked by
volcanism](Volcanology_of_New_Zealand "wikilink").[^192] The highly
active [Taup Volcanic Zone](Taup_Volcanic_Zone "wikilink") has formed
a large [volcanic plateau](North_Island_Volcanic_Plateau "wikilink"),
punctuated by the North Island\'s highest mountain, [Mount
Ruapehu](Mount_Ruapehu "wikilink") (`{{convert|2797|m}}`{=mediawiki}).
The plateau also hosts the country\'s largest lake, [Lake
Taup](Lake_Taup "wikilink"),[^193] nestled in the
[caldera](caldera "wikilink") of one of the world\'s most active
[supervolcanoes](supervolcano "wikilink").[^194] New Zealand is prone to
[earthquakes](List_of_earthquakes_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") and
[volcanic](Volcanism_of_New_Zealand "wikilink") eruptions.

The country owes its varied topography, and perhaps even its emergence
above the waves, to the dynamic boundary it straddles between the
[Pacific](Pacific_Plate "wikilink") and [Indo-Australian
Plates](Indo-Australian_Plate "wikilink").[^195] New Zealand is part of
[Zealandia](Zealandia "wikilink"), a
[microcontinent](microcontinent "wikilink") nearly half the size of
Australia that gradually submerged after breaking away from the
[Gondwanan](Gondwana "wikilink") supercontinent.[^196][^197] About 25
million years ago, a shift in [plate
tectonic](plate_tectonic "wikilink") movements began to [contort and
crumple](Kaikoura_orogeny "wikilink") the region. This is now most
evident in the Southern Alps, formed by [compression of the
crust](Continental_collision "wikilink") beside the [Alpine
Fault](Alpine_Fault "wikilink"). Elsewhere, the plate boundary involves
the [subduction](subduction "wikilink") of one plate under the other,
producing the [Puysegur Trench](Puysegur_Trench "wikilink") to the
south, the [Hikurangi Trench](Hikurangi_Trench "wikilink") east of the
North Island, and the [Kermadec](Kermadec_Trench "wikilink") and [Tonga
Trenches](Tonga_Trench "wikilink")[^198] further north.[^199]

New Zealand, together with Australia, is part of a region known as
[Australasia](Australasia "wikilink").[^200] It also forms the
southwestern extremity of the geographic and ethnographic region called
[Polynesia](Polynesia "wikilink").[^201] [Oceania](Oceania "wikilink")
is a wider region encompassing the [Australian
continent](Australia_(continent) "wikilink"), New Zealand, and various
island countries in the Pacific Ocean that are not included in the
[seven-continent](continent "wikilink") model.[^202]

New Zealand\'s climate is predominantly temperate
[maritime](Oceanic_climate "wikilink")
([Kppen](Kppen_climate_classification "wikilink"): Cfb), with mean
annual temperatures ranging from
`{{convert|10|C|0|abbr=on}}`{=mediawiki} in the south to
`{{convert|16|C|0|abbr=on}}`{=mediawiki} in the north.[^203] Historical
[maxima and minima](maxima_and_minima "wikilink") are

[Rangiora](Rangiora "wikilink"),
[Canterbury](Canterbury_Region "wikilink") and
`{{convert|-25.6|C|2|abbr=on}}`{=mediawiki} in
[Ranfurly](Ranfurly,_New_Zealand "wikilink"),
[Otago](Otago "wikilink").[^204] Conditions vary sharply across regions
from extremely wet on the [West
Coast](West_Coast,_New_Zealand "wikilink") of the South Island to
[semi-arid](Semi-arid_climate "wikilink") in [Central
Otago](Central_Otago "wikilink") and the [Mackenzie
Basin](Mackenzie_Basin "wikilink") of inland Canterbury and
[subtropical](subtropical "wikilink") in
[Northland](Northland_Peninsula "wikilink").[^205][^206] Of the seven
largest cities, [Christchurch](Christchurch "wikilink") is the driest,
receiving on average only `{{convert|618|mm|in}}`{=mediawiki} of rain
per year and Wellington the wettest, receiving almost twice that
amount.[^207] Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch all receive a yearly
average of more than 2,000 hours of sunshine. The southern and
southwestern parts of the South Island have a cooler and cloudier
climate, with around 1,400--1,600 hours; the northern and northeastern
parts of the South Island are the sunniest areas of the country and
receive about 2,400--2,500 hours.[^208] The general snow season is early
June until early October, though [cold snaps](cold_snap "wikilink") can
occur outside this season.[^209] Snowfall is common in the eastern and
southern parts of the South Island and mountain areas across the
country.[^210]

### Biodiversity

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Biodiversity of New Zealand}}
```
![The endemic flightless [kiwi](kiwi_(bird) "wikilink") is a [national
icon](National_symbols_of_New_Zealand "wikilink").\|alt=Kiwi amongst
sticks](TeTuatahianui.jpg "The endemic flightless kiwi is a national icon.|alt=Kiwi amongst sticks")
New Zealand\'s [geographic isolation](geographic_isolation "wikilink")
for 80 million years[^212] and island
[biogeography](biogeography "wikilink") has influenced evolution of the
country\'s species of [animals](fauna "wikilink"),
[fungi](fungus "wikilink") and [plants](flora "wikilink"). Physical
isolation has caused biological isolation, resulting in a dynamic
evolutionary ecology with examples of distinctive plants and animals as
well as populations of widespread species.[^213][^214] The flora and
fauna of New Zealand were originally thought to have originated from New
Zealand\'s fragmentation off from Gondwana, however more recent evidence
postulates species resulted from dispersal.[^215] About 82% of New
Zealand\'s indigenous [vascular plants](vascular_plant "wikilink") are
[endemic](Endemism "wikilink"), covering 1,944 species across 65
[genera](genus "wikilink").[^216][^217] The number of fungi recorded
from New Zealand, including lichen-forming species, is not known, nor is
the proportion of those fungi which are endemic, but one estimate
suggests there are about 2,300 species of lichen-forming fungi in New
Zealand[^218] and 40% of these are endemic.[^219] The two main types of
forest are those dominated by broadleaf trees with emergent
[podocarps](podocarp "wikilink"), or by [southern
beech](Nothofagus "wikilink") in cooler climates.[^220] The remaining
vegetation types consist of grasslands, the majority of which are
[tussock](Tussock_grasslands_of_New_Zealand "wikilink").[^221]

Before the arrival of humans, an estimated 80% of the land was covered
in forest, with only [high alpine](tree_line "wikilink"), wet, infertile
and volcanic areas without trees.[^222] Massive
[deforestation](Deforestation_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") occurred after
humans arrived, with around half the forest cover lost to fire after
Polynesian settlement.[^223] Much of the remaining forest fell after
European settlement, being logged or cleared to make room for pastoral
farming, leaving forest occupying only 23% of the land.[^224]

![The giant [Haast\'s eagle](Haast's_eagle "wikilink") died out when
humans hunted its main prey, the [moa](moa "wikilink"), to
extinction.\|alt=An artist\'s rendition of a Haast\'s eagle attacking
two
moa](Giant_Haasts_eagle_attacking_New_Zealand_moa.jpg "The giant Haast's eagle died out when humans hunted its main prey, the moa, to extinction.|alt=An artist's rendition of a Haast's eagle attacking two moa")

The forests were dominated by [birds](Birds_of_New_Zealand "wikilink"),
and the lack of mammalian predators led to some like the
[kiwi](Kiwi_(bird) "wikilink"), [kkp](kkp "wikilink"),
[weka](weka "wikilink") and [takah](takah "wikilink") evolving
[flightlessness](flightless_bird "wikilink").[^225] The arrival of
humans, associated changes to habitat, and the introduction of
[rats](Polynesian_rat "wikilink"), ferrets and other mammals led to the
[extinction](List_of_New_Zealand_animals_extinct_in_the_Holocene "wikilink")
of many bird species, including [large birds](Megafauna "wikilink") like
the [moa](moa "wikilink") and [Haast\'s
eagle](Haast's_eagle "wikilink").[^226][^227]

Other indigenous animals are represented by reptiles
([tuatara](tuatara "wikilink"), [skinks](skink "wikilink") and
[geckos](List_of_geckos_of_New_Zealand "wikilink")),
[frogs](Leiopelmatidae "wikilink"),[^228] such as the protected
endangered [Hamilton\'s Frog](Hamilton's_Frog "wikilink"),
[spiders](Spiders_of_New_Zealand "wikilink"),[^229] insects
(`{{lang|mi|[[wt]]|italics=no}}`{=mediawiki}),[^230] and snails.[^231]
Some, such as the tuatara, are so unique that they have been called
[living fossils](living_fossil "wikilink").[^232] Three species of bats
([one](New_Zealand_greater_short-tailed_bat "wikilink") since extinct)
were the only sign of native land mammals in New Zealand until the 2006
discovery of bones from [a unique, mouse-sized land
mammal](Saint_Bathans_mammal "wikilink") at least 16 million years
old.[^233][^234] Marine mammals, however, are abundant, with almost half
the world\'s [cetaceans](cetacea "wikilink") (whales, dolphins, and
[porpoises](porpoise "wikilink")) and large numbers of [fur
seals](fur_seal "wikilink") reported in New Zealand waters.[^235] Many
seabirds breed in New Zealand, a third of them unique to the
country.[^236] More
[penguin](List_of_birds_of_New_Zealand#Penguins "wikilink") species are
found in New Zealand than in any other country, with 13 of the world\'s
18 penguin species.[^237]

Since human arrival, almost half of the country\'s vertebrate species
have become extinct, including at least fifty-one birds, three frogs,
three lizards, one freshwater fish, and one bat. Others are endangered
or have had their range severely reduced.[^238] However, New Zealand
conservationists have pioneered several methods to help threatened
wildlife recover, including island sanctuaries, pest control, wildlife
translocation, fostering and ecological [restoration of
islands](island_restoration "wikilink") and other [protected
areas](Protected_areas_of_New_Zealand "wikilink").[^239][^240][^241][^242]

New Zealand has an [advanced](advanced_economy "wikilink") [market

`{{As of|2021|alt=2021}}`{=mediawiki} [Human Development

`{{As of|2022|alt=2022}}`{=mediawiki} [Index of Economic
Freedom](Index_of_Economic_Freedom "wikilink").[^245] It is a
[high-income economy](high-income_economy "wikilink") with a
[nominal](Nominal_value "wikilink") [gross domestic
product](gross_domestic_product "wikilink") (GDP) per capita of
[US\$](United_States_dollar "wikilink")36,254.[^246] The currency is the
[New Zealand dollar](New_Zealand_dollar "wikilink"), informally known as
the \"Kiwi dollar\"; it also circulates in the Cook Islands (see [Cook
Islands dollar](Cook_Islands_dollar "wikilink")), Niue, Tokelau, and the
[Pitcairn Islands](Pitcairn_Islands "wikilink").[^247]

Historically, extractive industries have contributed strongly to New
Zealand\'s economy, focusing at different times on sealing, whaling,
[flax](Phormium "wikilink"), gold, [kauri gum](kauri_gum "wikilink"),
and native timber.[^248] The first shipment of refrigerated meat on the
*[Dunedin](Dunedin_(ship) "wikilink")* in 1882 led to the establishment
of meat and dairy exports to Britain, a trade which provided the basis
for strong economic growth in New Zealand.[^249] High demand for
agricultural products from the United Kingdom and the United States
helped New Zealanders achieve higher living standards than both
Australia and Western Europe in the 1950s and 1960s.[^250] In 1973, New
Zealand\'s export market was reduced when the United Kingdom joined the
[European Economic
Community](European_Economic_Community "wikilink")[^251] and other
compounding factors, such as the [1973 oil](1973_oil_crisis "wikilink")
and [1979 energy](1979_oil_crisis "wikilink") crises, led to a severe
[economic depression](Depression_(economics) "wikilink").[^252] Living
standards in New Zealand fell behind those of Australia and Western
Europe, and by 1982 New Zealand had the lowest per-capita income of all
the developed nations surveyed by [the World
Bank](World_Bank_Group "wikilink").[^253] In the mid-1980s New Zealand
deregulated its [agricultural
sector](Agriculture_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") by phasing out
[subsidies](agricultural_subsidy "wikilink") over a three-year
period.[^254][^255] Since 1984, successive governments engaged in major
[macroeconomic](macroeconomic "wikilink") restructuring (known first as
[Rogernomics](Rogernomics "wikilink") and then
[Ruthanasia](Ruthanasia "wikilink")), rapidly transforming New Zealand
from a [protectionist](Protectionism "wikilink") and highly regulated
economy to a liberalised [free-trade](free-trade "wikilink")
economy.[^256][^257]

Unemployment peaked just above 10% in 1991 and 1992,[^260] following the
[1987 share market crash](Black_Monday_(1987)#New_Zealand "wikilink"),
but eventually fell to a record low (since 1986) of 3.7% in 2007
(ranking third from twenty-seven comparable OECD nations).[^261]
However, the [global financial
crisis](Financial_crisis_of_20072008 "wikilink") that followed had a
major effect on New Zealand, with the GDP shrinking for five consecutive
quarters, the longest recession in over thirty years,[^262][^263] and
unemployment rising back to 7% in late 2009.[^264] Unemployment rates
for different age groups follow similar trends but are consistently
higher among youth. In the December 2014 quarter, the general
unemployment rate was around 5.8%, while the unemployment rate for youth
aged 15 to 21 was 15.6%.[^265] New Zealand has experienced a series of
\"[brain drains](brain_drain "wikilink")\" since the 1970s[^266] that
still continue today.[^267] Nearly one-quarter of highly skilled workers
live overseas, mostly in Australia and Britain, which is the largest
proportion from any developed nation.[^268] In recent decades, however,
a \"brain gain\" has brought in educated professionals from Europe and
less developed countries.[^269]`{{sfn|Bain|2006|p=44}}`{=mediawiki}
Today New Zealand\'s economy benefits from a high level of
[innovation](innovation "wikilink").[^270]

[Poverty in New Zealand](Poverty_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") is
characterised by growing income inequality; wealth in New Zealand is
[highly
concentrated](Economic_inequality_in_New_Zealand "wikilink"),[^271] with
the top 1% of the population owning 16% of the country\'s wealth, and
the richest 5% owning 38%, leaving a stark contrast where half the
population, including [state
beneficiaries](Welfare_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") and pensioners,
receive less than \$24,000.[^272] Moreover, [child poverty in New
Zealand](child_poverty_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") has been identified by
the Government as a major societal issue;[^273][^274] the country has
12.0% of children living in low-income households that had less than 50
percent of the median equivalised disposable household income
`{{as of|June 2022|lc=on}}`{=mediawiki}.[^275] Poverty has a
disproportionately high effect in ethnic-minority households, with a
quarter (23.3%) of Mori children and almost a third (28.6%) of Pacific
Islander children living in poverty
`{{as of|2020|lc=on}}`{=mediawiki}.[^276]

### Trade

New Zealand is heavily dependent on international trade,[^277]
particularly in agricultural products.[^278] Exports account for 24% of
its output,[^279] making New Zealand vulnerable to international
commodity prices and global [economic slowdowns](Recession "wikilink").
Food products made up 55% of the value of all the country\'s exports in
2014; wood was the second largest earner (7%).[^280] New Zealand\'s main
trading partners, `{{as of|June 2018|alt=as at June 2018}}`{=mediawiki},
are China ([NZ\$](NZ$ "wikilink")27.8b), Australia (\$26.2b), the
[European Union](European_Union "wikilink") (\$22.9b), the United States
(\$17.6b), and Japan (\$8.4b).[^281] On 7 April 2008, New Zealand and
China signed the [New Zealand--China Free Trade
Agreement](New_ZealandChina_Free_Trade_Agreement "wikilink"), the first
such agreement China has signed with a developed country.[^282] In July
2023, New Zealand and the European Union entered into the [EU--New
Zealand Free Trade
Agreement](New_ZealandEuropean_Union_relations#EU-NZ_free_trade_agreement "wikilink"),
which eliminated tariffs on several goods traded between the two
regions.[^283] This free trade agreement expanded on the pre-existing
free trade agreement[^284] and saw a reduction in tariffs on meat and
dairy[^285] in response to feedback from the affected industries.[^286]

The service sector is the largest sector in the economy, followed by
manufacturing and construction and then farming and raw material
extraction.[^287] [Tourism](Tourism_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") plays a
significant role in the economy, contributing \$12.9 billion (or 5.6%)
to New Zealand\'s total GDP and supporting 7.5% of the total workforce
in 2016.[^288] In 2017, international visitor arrivals were expected to
increase at a rate of 5.4% annually up to 2022.[^289]

![Wool has historically been one of New Zealand\'s major exports.\|alt=A
Romney ewe with her two
lambs](Fauna_de_Nueva_Zelanda07.JPG "Wool has historically been one of New Zealand's major exports.|alt=A Romney ewe with her two lambs")

Wool was New Zealand\'s major agricultural export during the late 19th
century.[^290] Even as late as the 1960s it made up over a third of all
export revenues,[^291] but since then its price has steadily dropped
relative to other commodities,[^292] and wool is no longer profitable
for many farmers.[^293] In contrast, [dairy
farming](Dairy_farming_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") increased, with the
number of dairy cows doubling between 1990 and 2007,[^294] to become New
Zealand\'s largest export earner.[^295] In the year to June 2018, dairy
products accounted for 17.7% (\$14.1 billion) of total exports,[^296]
and the country\'s largest company, [Fonterra](Fonterra "wikilink"),
controls almost one-third of the international dairy trade.[^297] Other
exports in 2017--18 were meat (8.8%), wood and wood products (6.2%),
fruit (3.6%), machinery (2.2%) and wine (2.1%).[^298] [New Zealand\'s
wine](New_Zealand_wine "wikilink") industry has followed a similar trend
to dairy, the number of vineyards doubling over the same period,[^299]
overtaking wool exports for the first time in 2007.[^300][^301]

### Infrastructure

In 2015, [renewable energy](Renewable_energy_in_New_Zealand "wikilink")
generated 40.1% of [New Zealand\'s gross
energy](Energy_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") supply.[^302] The majority of
the country\'s [electricity
supply](Electricity_sector_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") is generated from
[hydroelectric power](Hydroelectric_power_in_New_Zealand "wikilink"),
with major schemes on the [Waikato](Waikato_River "wikilink"),
[Waitaki](Waitaki_River "wikilink") and [Clutha /
Mata-Au](Clutha_River_/_Mata-Au "wikilink") rivers, as well as at
[Manapouri](Manapouri_Power_Station "wikilink"). [Geothermal
power](Geothermal_power_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") is also a significant
generator of electricity, with several large stations located across the
Taup Volcanic Zone in the North Island. The four main companies in the
generation and retail market are [Contact
Energy](Contact_Energy "wikilink"), [Genesis
Energy](Genesis_Energy_Limited "wikilink"), [Mercury
Energy](Mercury_Energy "wikilink") and [Meridian
Energy](Meridian_Energy "wikilink"). State-owned
[Transpower](Transpower_New_Zealand "wikilink") operates the
high-voltage transmission grids in the North and South Islands, as well
as the [Inter-Island HVDC link](HVDC_Inter-Island "wikilink") connecting
the two together.[^303]

The provision of [water supply and
sanitation](water_supply_and_sanitation_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") is
generally of good quality. Regional authorities provide water
abstraction, treatment and distribution infrastructure to most developed
areas.[^304][^305]

[New Zealand\'s transport](Transport_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") network
comprises `{{convert|94000|km|mi|-1}}`{=mediawiki} of roads, including
`{{convert|199|km|mi|0}}`{=mediawiki} of motorways,[^306] and
`{{convert|4128|km|mi|0}}`{=mediawiki} of railway lines.[^307] Most
major cities and towns are linked by bus services, although the private
car is the predominant mode of transport.[^308] The
[railways](Rail_transport_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") were privatised in
1993 but were re-nationalised by the government in stages between 2004
and 2008. The state-owned enterprise [KiwiRail](KiwiRail "wikilink") now
operates the railways, with the exception of commuter services in
Auckland and Wellington, which are operated by [Auckland One
Rail](Auckland_One_Rail "wikilink") and [Transdev
Wellington](Transdev_Wellington "wikilink") respectively.[^309] Railways
run the length of the country, although most lines now carry freight
rather than passengers.[^310] The road and rail networks in the two main
islands are linked by [roll-on/roll-off](roll-on/roll-off "wikilink")
ferries between Wellington and [Picton](Picton,_New_Zealand "wikilink"),
operated by [Interislander](Interislander "wikilink") (part of KiwiRail)
and [Bluebridge](StraitNZ "wikilink"). Most international visitors
arrive via air.[^311] New Zealand has [four international
airports](List_of_airports_in_New_Zealand "wikilink"):
[Auckland](Auckland_Airport "wikilink"),
[Christchurch](Christchurch_Airport "wikilink"),
[Queenstown](Queenstown_Airport "wikilink") and
[Wellington](Wellington_Airport "wikilink"); however, only Auckland and
Christchurch offer non-stop flights to countries other than Australia or
Fiji.[^312]

The [New Zealand Post Office](New_Zealand_Post_Office "wikilink") had a
monopoly over [telecommunications in New
Zealand](telecommunications_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") until 1987 when
[Telecom New Zealand](Spark_New_Zealand "wikilink") was formed,
initially as a state-owned enterprise and then privatised in 1990.[^313]
[Chorus](Chorus_Limited "wikilink"), which was split from Telecom (now
Spark) in 2011,[^314] still owns the majority of the telecommunications
infrastructure, but competition from other providers has
increased.[^315] A large-scale rollout of gigabit-capable [fibre to the
premises](fibre_to_the_premises "wikilink"), branded as [Ultra-Fast
Broadband](Ultra-Fast_Broadband "wikilink"), began in 2009 with a target
of being available to 87% of the population by 2022.[^316]
`{{As of|2017}}`{=mediawiki}, the United Nations [International
Telecommunication
Union](International_Telecommunication_Union "wikilink") ranks New
Zealand 13th in the development of information and communications
infrastructure.[^317]

### Science and technology {#science_and_technology}

Early indigenous contribution to science in New Zealand was by Mori
`{{lang|mi|[[tohunga]]}}`{=mediawiki} accumulating knowledge of
agricultural practice and the effects of herbal remedies in the
treatment of illness and disease.[^318] [Cook](James_Cook "wikilink")\'s
voyages in the 1700s and [Darwin](Charles_Darwin "wikilink")\'s in 1835
had important scientific botanical and zoological objectives.[^319] The
establishment of universities in the 19th century fostered scientific
discoveries by notable New Zealanders including [Ernest
Rutherford](Ernest_Rutherford "wikilink") for splitting the atom,
[William Pickering](Bill_Pickering_(rocket_scientist) "wikilink") for
rocket science, [Maurice Wilkins](Maurice_Wilkins "wikilink") for
helping discover DNA, [Beatrice Tinsley](Beatrice_Tinsley "wikilink")
for galaxy formation, [Archibald McIndoe](Archibald_McIndoe "wikilink")
for plastic surgery, and [Alan MacDiarmid](Alan_MacDiarmid "wikilink")
for conducting polymers.[^320]

[Crown Research Institutes](Crown_Research_Institute "wikilink") (CRIs)
were formed in 1992 from existing government-owned research
organisations. Their role is to research and develop new science,
knowledge, products and services across the economic, environmental,
social and cultural spectrum for the benefit of New Zealand.[^321] The
total gross expenditure on [research and
development](research_and_development "wikilink") (R&D) as a proportion
of GDP rose to 1.37% in 2018, up from 1.23% in 2015. New Zealand ranks
21st in the OECD for its gross R&D spending as a percentage of
GDP.[^322] New Zealand was ranked 27th in the [Global Innovation
Index](Global_Innovation_Index "wikilink") in 2023.[^323]

The [New Zealand Space Agency](New_Zealand_Space_Agency "wikilink") was
created by the government in 2016 for space policy, regulation and
sector development. [Rocket Lab](Rocket_Lab "wikilink") was the notable
first commercial rocket launcher in the country.[^324]

The majority of private and commercial research organisations in New
Zealand are focused on the agricultural and fisheries sectors. Examples
include the [Cawthron Institute](Cawthron_Institute "wikilink"), the
[Livestock Improvement
Corporation](Livestock_Improvement_Corporation "wikilink"), the
[Fonterra Research and Development
Centre](Fonterra#Fonterra_Research_and_Development_Centre "wikilink"),
the [Bragato Research
Institute](New_Zealand_Winegrowers#Bragato_Research_Institute "wikilink"),
the [Kiwifruit Breeding
Centre](Zespri#Kiwifruit_Breeding_Centre "wikilink"), and [B+LNZ
Genetics](Beef_%2B_Lamb_New_Zealand#B+LNZ_Genetics "wikilink").

population of 4,699,755, an increase of 10.8% over the [2013
census](2013_New_Zealand_census "wikilink") figure.[^325] As of
`{{currentmonth}}`{=mediawiki} `{{currentyear}}`{=mediawiki}, the total
population has risen to an estimated
`{{formatnum:{{data New Zealand|poptoday}}}}`{=mediawiki}.[^326] New
Zealand\'s population increased at a rate of 1.9% per year in the seven
years ended June 2020. In September 2020 [Statistics New
Zealand](Statistics_New_Zealand "wikilink") reported that the population
had climbed above 5 million people in September 2019, according to
population estimates based on the 2018
census.[^327]`{{refn|A provisional estimate initially indicated the milestone was reached six months later in March 2020, before population estimates were rebased from the 2013 census to the 2018 census.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pullar-Strecker |first=Tom |title=New Zealand population tops 5 million |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/121544285/new-zealand-population-tops-5-million |work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff.co.nz]] |date=18 May 2020 |access-date=18 May 2020 |archive-date=12 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230212113142/https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/121544285/new-zealand-population-tops-5-million |url-status=live }}</ref>|group=n}}`{=mediawiki}

New Zealand\'s population today is concentrated to the north of the
country, with around
`{{Rnd|{{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|North Island regions|y}}|R}}/{{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|New Zealand|y}}|R}}*100|1}}`{=mediawiki}%

During the 20th century, New Zealand\'s population [drifted
north](Drift_to_the_north "wikilink"). In 1921, the country\'s [median
centre of population](Center_of_population "wikilink") was located in
the Tasman Sea west of [Levin](Levin,_New_Zealand "wikilink") in
[Manawat-Whanganui](Manawat-Whanganui "wikilink"); by 2017, it had
moved `{{Convert|280|km|abbr=on}}`{=mediawiki} north to near
[Kawhia](Kawhia_Harbour "wikilink") in Waikato.[^328]

New Zealand is a predominantly urban country, with
`{{Decimals|({{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Major urban area|y}}|R}}+{{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Large urban area|y}}|R}}+{{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Medium urban area|y}}|R}}+{{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Small urban area|y}}|R}})/{{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|New Zealand|y}}|R}}*100|1}}`{=mediawiki}%

of the population living in the seven cities with populations exceeding
100,000.`{{NZ population data 2018||||y}}`{=mediawiki}
[Auckland](Auckland "wikilink"), with over 1.4 million residents, is by
far the largest city.[^329] New Zealand cities generally rank highly on
international livability measures. For instance, in 2016, Auckland was
ranked the world\'s third [most liveable
city](most_liveable_city "wikilink") and Wellington the twelfth by the
Mercer Quality of Living Survey.[^330]

The [median age](median_age "wikilink") of the New Zealand population at
the 2018 census was 37.4 years,[^331] with life expectancy in 2017--2019
being 80.0 years for males and 83.5 years for females.[^332] While New
Zealand is experiencing [sub-replacement
fertility](sub-replacement_fertility "wikilink"), with a total fertility
rate of 1.6 in 2020, the fertility rate is above the OECD
average.[^333][^334] By 2050, the median age is projected to rise to 43
years and the percentage of people 60 years of age and older to rise
from 18% to 29%.[^335] In 2016 the leading cause of death was
[cancer](cancer "wikilink") at 30.3%, followed by [ischaemic heart
disease](Coronary_artery_disease "wikilink") (14.9%) and
[cerebrovascular disease](cerebrovascular_disease "wikilink")
(7.4%).[^336] `{{As of|2016}}`{=mediawiki}, total expenditure on [health
care](health_care_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") (including private sector
spending) is 9.2% of GDP.[^337]

### Ethnicity and immigration {#ethnicity_and_immigration}

![Pedestrians on [Queen Street](Queen_Street,_Auckland "wikilink") in
Auckland, an ethnically diverse city\|alt=Pedestrians crossing a wide
street which is flanked by
storefronts](Queen_Street_Midtown_Auckland.jpg "Pedestrians on Queen Street in Auckland, an ethnically diverse city|alt=Pedestrians crossing a wide street which is flanked by storefronts")

In the [2018 census](2018_New_Zealand_census "wikilink"), 71.8% of New
Zealand residents identified ethnically as European, and 16.5% as
[Mori](Mori_people "wikilink"). Other major ethnic groups include
[Asian](Asian_New_Zealanders "wikilink") (15.3%) and [Pacific
peoples](Pasifika_New_Zealanders "wikilink") (9.0%), two-thirds of whom
live in the [Auckland
Region](Auckland_Region "wikilink").`{{refn|name="ethnicity"|group=n}}`{=mediawiki}[^338]
The population has become more multicultural and diverse in recent
decades: in 1961, the census reported that the population of New Zealand
was 92% European and 7% Mori, with Asian and Pacific minorities sharing
the remaining 1%.[^339]

While the [demonym](demonym "wikilink") for a New Zealand citizen is New
Zealander, the informal \"[Kiwi](Kiwi_(nickname) "wikilink")\" is
commonly used both internationally[^340] and by locals.[^341] The Mori
loanword `{{lang|mi|[[Pkeh]]}}`{=mediawiki} has been used to refer to
[New Zealanders of European
descent](European_New_Zealanders "wikilink"), although some reject this
name. The word today is increasingly used to refer to all non-Polynesian
New Zealanders.[^342]

The Mori were the first people to reach New Zealand, followed by the
early [European settlers](Pkeh_settlers "wikilink"). Following
colonisation, immigrants were predominantly from Britain, Ireland and
Australia because of restrictive policies similar to the [White
Australia policy](White_Australia_policy "wikilink").[^343] There was
also significant [Dutch](Dutch_people "wikilink"),
[Dalmatian](Dalmatia "wikilink"),[^344] [German](Germany "wikilink"),
and [Italian](Italians "wikilink") immigration, together with indirect
European immigration through Australia, North America, South America and
South Africa.[^345][^346] Net migration increased after the [Second
World War](World_War_II "wikilink"); in the 1970s and 1980s policies on
immigration were relaxed, and immigration from Asia was
promoted.[^347][^348] In 2009--10, an annual target of 45,000--50,000
permanent residence approvals was set by the New Zealand Immigration
Service---more than one new migrant for every 100 New Zealand
residents.[^349] In the 2018 census, 27.4% of people counted were not
born in New Zealand, up from 25.2% in the [2013
census](2013_New_Zealand_census "wikilink"). Over half (52.4%) of New
Zealand\'s overseas-born population lives in the Auckland Region.[^350]
The United Kingdom remains the largest source of New Zealand\'s
immigrant population, with around a quarter of all overseas-born New
Zealanders born there; other major sources of New Zealand\'s
overseas-born population are [China](China "wikilink"),
[India](India "wikilink"), [Australia](Australia "wikilink"), [South
Africa](South_Africa "wikilink"), [Fiji](Fiji "wikilink") and
[Samoa](Samoa "wikilink").[^351] The number of fee-paying [international
students](international_student "wikilink") increased sharply in the
late 1990s, with more than 20,000 studying in public [tertiary
institutions](Tertiary_education "wikilink") in 2002.[^352]

English is the predominant language in New Zealand, spoken by 95.4% of
the population.[^355] [New Zealand
English](New_Zealand_English "wikilink") is a variety of the language
with a distinctive [accent](Accent_(sociolinguistics) "wikilink") and
lexicon.[^356] It is similar to [Australian
English](Australian_English "wikilink"), and many speakers from the
Northern Hemisphere are unable to tell the accents
apart.`{{sfn|Hay|Maclagan|Gordon|2008|p=14}}`{=mediawiki} The most
prominent differences between the New Zealand English dialect and other
English dialects are the shifts in the short front vowels: the short-*i*
sound (as in *kit*) has centralised towards the
[schwa](schwa "wikilink") sound (the *a* in *comma* and *about*); the
short-*e* sound (as in *dress*) has moved towards the short-*i* sound;
and the short-*a* sound (as in *trap*) has moved to the short-*e*
sound.[^357]

After the Second World War, Mori were discouraged or forced from
speaking their own language (`{{lang|mi|[[te reo Mori]]}}`{=mediawiki})
in schools and workplaces, and it existed as a community language only
in a few remote areas.[^358] The Native Schools Act 1867 required
instruction in English in all schools, and while there was no official
policy banning children from speaking Mori, many suffered from
[physical abuse](physical_abuse "wikilink") if they did
so.[^359][^360][^361] The Mori language has recently undergone a
process of revitalisation,[^362] being declared one of New Zealand\'s
official languages in 1987,[^363] and is spoken by 4.0% of the
population.[^364]`{{refn|In 2015, 55% of Mori adults (aged 15 years and over) reported knowledge of {{lang|mi|te reo Mori}}.

places](List_of_dual_place_names_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") have both
their Mori and English names officially recognised.[^366]

As recorded in the 2018 census,[^367]
[Samoan](Samoan_language "wikilink") is the most widely spoken
non-official language (2.2%), followed by \"Northern Chinese\"
(including [Mandarin](Mandarin_Chinese "wikilink"), 2.0%),
[Hindi](Hindi "wikilink") (1.5%), and French (1.2%). [New Zealand Sign
Language](New_Zealand_Sign_Language "wikilink") was reported to be
understood by 22,986 people (0.5%); it became one of New Zealand\'s
official languages in 2006.[^368]

[Christianity](Christianity_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") is the
predominant religion in New Zealand, although its society is among the
most [secular](secular "wikilink") in the world.[^371][^372] In the 2018
census, 44.7% of respondents identified with one or more religions,
including 37.0% identifying as Christians. Another 48.5% indicated that
they had no
religion.`{{refn|1=Religion percentages may not add to 100% as people could claim multiple religions or object to answering the question.|group=n}}`{=mediawiki}[^373]
Of those who affiliate with a particular Christian denomination, the
main responses are
[Anglicanism](Anglican_Church_in_Aotearoa,_New_Zealand_and_Polynesia "wikilink")
(6.7%),`{{refn|1=This is a percentage of total respondents to the census, not a percentage of Christians.|group=n}}`{=mediawiki}
[Roman Catholicism](Catholic_Church_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") (6.3%),
and
[Presbyterianism](Presbyterian_Church_of_Aotearoa_New_Zealand "wikilink")
(4.7%).[^374] The Mori-based [Ringat](Ringat "wikilink") and
[Rtana](Rtana "wikilink") denominations (1.2%) are also Christian in
origin.[^375][^376] Immigration and demographic change in recent decades
have contributed to the growth of minority religions, such as
[Hinduism](Hinduism_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") (2.6%),
[Islam](Islam_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") (1.3%),
[Buddhism](Buddhism_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") (1.1%), and
[Sikhism](Sikhism_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") (0.9%).[^377] The Auckland
Region exhibited the greatest religious diversity.[^378]

### Education

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Education in New Zealand|Tertiary education in New Zealand}}
```
Primary and secondary schooling is compulsory for children aged 6 to 16,
with the majority of children attending from the age of 5.[^379] There
are 13 school years and attending [state (public)
schools](State_school "wikilink") is free to New Zealand citizens and
permanent residents from a person\'s 5th birthday to the end of the
calendar year following their 19th birthday.[^380] New Zealand has an
adult literacy rate of 99%,[^381] and over half of the population aged
15 to 29 hold a tertiary qualification.[^382] There are five types of
government-owned tertiary institutions:
[universities](University "wikilink"), colleges of education,
[polytechnics](Institute_of_technology#New_Zealand "wikilink"),
specialist colleges, and [wnanga](wnanga "wikilink"),[^383] in
addition to private training establishments.[^384] In 2021, in the
population aged 25--64; 13% had no formal qualification, 21% had a
school qualification, 28% had a tertiary certificate or diploma, and 35%
have a [bachelor\'s degree](bachelor's_degree "wikilink") or
higher.[^385] The OECD\'s [Programme for International Student
Assessment](Programme_for_International_Student_Assessment "wikilink")
ranks New Zealand as the 28th best in the [OECD](OECD "wikilink") for
maths, 13th best for science, and 11th best for reading.[^386]

## Culture

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Culture of New Zealand}}
```
```{=mediawiki}
{{Tall image|KupeWheke.jpg|150|350|alt=Tall wooden carving showing Kupe above two tentacled sea creatures|Late 20th-century house-post depicting the navigator [[Kupe]] fighting two sea creatures|right}}
```
Early Mori adapted the tropically based east [Polynesian
culture](Polynesian_culture "wikilink") in line with the challenges
associated with a larger and more diverse environment, eventually
developing their own distinctive culture. Social organisation was
largely communal with families (*[whnau](whnau "wikilink")*),
subtribes (*hap*) and tribes (*iwi*) ruled by a chief
(*[rangatira](rangatira "wikilink")*), whose position was subject to the
community\'s approval.`{{sfn|Kennedy|2007|p=398}}`{=mediawiki} The
British and Irish immigrants brought aspects of their own culture to New
Zealand and also influenced Mori culture,[^387][^388] particularly with
the introduction of Christianity.[^389] However, Mori still regard
their allegiance to tribal groups as a vital part of [their
identity](Cultural_identity "wikilink"), and Mori kinship roles
resemble [those of other Polynesian
peoples](Hawaiian_kinship "wikilink").[^390] More recently,
[American](Culture_of_the_United_States "wikilink"),
[Australian](Culture_of_Australia "wikilink"),
[Asian](Culture_of_Asia "wikilink") and other [European
cultures](Culture_of_Europe "wikilink") have exerted influence on New
Zealand. Non-Mori Polynesian cultures are also apparent, with
[Pasifika](Pasifika_Festival "wikilink"), the world\'s largest
Polynesian festival, now an annual event in Auckland.[^391]

The largely rural life in early New Zealand led to the image of New
Zealanders being rugged, industrious problem
solvers.`{{sfn|Kennedy|2007|p=400}}`{=mediawiki} Modesty was expected
and enforced through the \"[tall poppy
syndrome](tall_poppy_syndrome "wikilink")\", where high achievers
received harsh criticism.`{{sfn|Kennedy|2007|p=399}}`{=mediawiki} At the
time, New Zealand was not known as an intellectual country.[^392] From
the early 20th century until the late 1960s, Mori culture was
suppressed by the attempted
[assimilation](cultural_assimilation "wikilink") of Mori into British
New Zealanders.[^393] In the 1960s, as tertiary education became more
available, and [cities expanded](Urbanization "wikilink")[^394] urban
culture began to dominate.[^395] However, rural imagery and themes are
common in New Zealand\'s art, literature and media.[^396]

[New Zealand\'s national
symbols](National_symbols_of_New_Zealand "wikilink") are influenced by
natural, historical, and Mori sources. The [silver
fern](silver_fern "wikilink") is an emblem appearing on army insignia
and sporting team uniforms.[^397] Certain items of popular culture
thought to be unique to New Zealand are called
\"[Kiwiana](Kiwiana "wikilink")\".[^398]

### Art

[hei-tiki](hei-tiki "wikilink") and woven cloak\|alt=Refer to
caption](Hinepare.jpg "Portrait of Hinepare of Ngti Kahungunu by Gottfried Lindauer, showing chin moko, pounamu hei-tiki and woven cloak|alt=Refer to caption")
As part of the resurgence of Mori culture, the traditional crafts of
carving and weaving are now more widely practised, and Mori artists are
increasing in number and influence.[^399] Most Mori carvings feature
human figures, generally with three fingers and either a
natural-looking, detailed head or a grotesque head.[^400] Surface
patterns consisting of spirals, ridges, notches and fish scales decorate
most carvings.[^401] The pre-eminent Mori architecture consisted of
carved meeting houses (*[wharenui](wharenui "wikilink")*) decorated with
symbolic carvings and illustrations. These buildings were originally
designed to be constantly rebuilt, changing and adapting to different
whims or needs.[^402]

Mori decorated the white wood of buildings, canoes and cenotaphs using
red (a mixture of red [ochre](ochre "wikilink") and shark fat) and black
(made from soot) paint and painted pictures of birds, reptiles and other
designs on cave walls.[^403] Mori tattoos
(*[moko](T_moko "wikilink")*) consisting of coloured soot mixed with
gum were cut into the flesh with a bone chisel.[^404] Since European
arrival paintings and photographs have been dominated by landscapes,
originally not as works of art but as factual portrayals of New
Zealand.[^405] Portraits of Mori were also common, with early painters
often portraying them as an ideal race untainted by civilisation.[^406]
The country\'s isolation delayed the influence of European artistic
trends allowing local artists to develop their own distinctive style of
[regionalism](Regionalism_(art) "wikilink").[^407] During the 1960s and
1970s, many artists combined traditional Mori and Western techniques,
creating unique art forms.[^408] New Zealand art and craft has gradually
achieved an international audience, with exhibitions in the [Venice
Biennale](Venice_Biennale "wikilink") in 2001 and the \"Paradise Now\"
exhibition in New York in 2004.[^409][^410]

Mori cloaks are made of fine flax fibre and patterned with black, red
and white triangles, diamonds and other geometric shapes.[^411]
[Greenstone](Pounamu "wikilink") was fashioned into earrings and
necklaces, with the most well-known design being the
[hei-tiki](hei-tiki "wikilink"), a distorted human figure sitting
cross-legged with its head tilted to the side.[^412] Europeans brought
English fashion etiquette to New Zealand, and until the 1950s most
people dressed up for social occasions.[^413] Standards have since
relaxed and New Zealand fashion has received a reputation for being
casual, practical and lacklustre.[^414][^415] However, the local fashion
industry has grown significantly since 2000, doubling exports and
increasing from a handful to about 50 established labels, with some
labels gaining international recognition.[^416]

### Literature

```{=mediawiki}
{{main|New Zealand literature}}
```
Mori quickly adopted writing as a means of sharing ideas, and many of
their oral stories and poems were converted to the written form.[^417]
Most early English literature was obtained from Britain, and it was not
until the 1950s when local publishing outlets increased that New Zealand
literature started to become widely known.[^418] Although still largely
influenced by global trends ([modernism](Literary_modernism "wikilink"))
and events (the Great Depression), writers in the 1930s began to develop
stories increasingly focused on their experiences in New Zealand. During
this period, literature changed from a
[journalistic](Journalism "wikilink") activity to a more academic
pursuit.[^419] Participation in the world wars gave some New Zealand
writers a new perspective on New Zealand culture and with the post-war
expansion of universities local literature flourished.[^420] Dunedin is
a UNESCO [City of Literature](City_of_Literature "wikilink").[^421]

### Media and entertainment {#media_and_entertainment}

```{=mediawiki}
{{main|Music of New Zealand|Cinema of New Zealand|Media of New Zealand}}
```
New Zealand music has been influenced by [blues](blues "wikilink"),
[jazz](jazz "wikilink"), [country](country_music "wikilink"), [rock and
roll](rock_and_roll "wikilink") and [hip hop](hip_hop_music "wikilink"),
with many of these genres given a unique New Zealand
interpretation.[^422] Mori developed traditional chants and songs from
their ancient Southeast Asian origins, and after centuries of isolation
created a unique \"monotonous\" and
\"[doleful](wikt:doleful "wikilink")\" sound.[^423] Flutes and trumpets
were used as musical instruments[^424] or as signalling devices during
war or special occasions.[^425] Early settlers brought over their ethnic
music, with [brass bands](brass_band "wikilink") and [choral
music](choir "wikilink") being popular, and musicians began touring New
Zealand in the 1860s.[^426][^427] [Pipe bands](Pipe_band "wikilink")
became widespread during the early 20th century.[^428] The New Zealand
recording industry began to develop from 1940 onwards, and many New
Zealand musicians have obtained success in Britain and the United
States.[^429] Some artists release Mori language songs, and the Mori
tradition-based art of *[kapa haka](kapa_haka "wikilink")* (song and
dance) has made a resurgence.[^430] The [New Zealand Music
Awards](New_Zealand_Music_Awards "wikilink") are held annually by
[Recorded Music NZ](Recorded_Music_NZ "wikilink"); the awards were first
held in 1965 by [Reckitt & Colman](Reckitt_&_Colman "wikilink") as the
[Loxene Golden Disc](Loxene_Golden_Disc "wikilink") awards.[^431]
Recorded Music NZ also publishes the country\'s [official weekly record
charts](Official_New_Zealand_Music_Chart "wikilink").[^432]

![The [Hobbiton Movie Set](Hobbiton_Movie_Set "wikilink"), located near
[Matamata](Matamata "wikilink"), was used for *The Lord of the Rings*
film
trilogy.[^433]](Hobbit_holes_reflected_in_water.jpg "The Hobbiton Movie Set, located near Matamata, was used for The Lord of the Rings film trilogy.")
Public [radio](Radio_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") was introduced in New
Zealand in 1922.[^435] A state-owned [television
service](Television_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") began in 1960.[^436]
Deregulation in the 1980s saw a sudden increase in the numbers of radio
and television stations.[^437] New Zealand television primarily
broadcasts American and British programming, along with many Australian
and local shows.[^438] The number of [New Zealand
films](List_of_New_Zealand_films "wikilink") significantly increased
during the 1970s. In 1978 the [New Zealand Film
Commission](New_Zealand_Film_Commission "wikilink") started assisting
local film-makers, and many films attained a world audience, some
receiving international acknowledgement.[^439] The highest-grossing New
Zealand films are *[Hunt for the
Wilderpeople](Hunt_for_the_Wilderpeople "wikilink")*,
*[Boy](Boy_(2010_film) "wikilink")*, *[The World\'s Fastest
Indian](The_World's_Fastest_Indian "wikilink")*, *[Whale
Rider](Whale_Rider "wikilink")*, *[Once Were
Warriors](Once_Were_Warriors_(film) "wikilink")*, *[Heavenly
Creatures](Heavenly_Creatures "wikilink")* and *[The
Piano](The_Piano "wikilink")*.[^440] The country\'s diverse scenery and
compact size, plus government incentives,[^441] have encouraged some
[producers](Film_producer "wikilink") to shoot very big-budget and well
known productions in New Zealand, including *[The Lord of the
Rings](The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series) "wikilink")* and *[The
Hobbit](The_Hobbit_(film_series) "wikilink")* film trilogies,
*[Avatar](Avatar_(2009_film) "wikilink")*, *[The Chronicles of
Narnia](The_Chronicles_of_Narnia_(film_series) "wikilink")*, *[King
Kong](King_Kong_(2005_film) "wikilink")*,
*[Wolverine](X-Men_Origins:_Wolverine "wikilink")*, *[The Last
Samurai](The_Last_Samurai "wikilink")* and *[The Power of the
Dog](The_Power_of_the_Dog_(film) "wikilink")*.[^442] The New Zealand
media industry is dominated by a small number of companies, most of
which are foreign-owned, although the [state retains
ownership](Crown_entity "wikilink") of some television and radio
stations.[^443] Since 1994, [Freedom House](Freedom_House "wikilink")
has consistently ranked New Zealand\'s press freedom in the top twenty,
with the 19th freest media

the
feet.](Haka_2006.jpg "A haka performed by the national rugby union team ("All Blacks") before a game. The haka is a challenge with vigorous movements and stamping of the feet.")

Most of the major sporting codes played in New Zealand have British
origins.[^445] [Rugby union](Rugby_union "wikilink") is considered the
[national sport](national_sport "wikilink")[^446] and attracts the most
spectators.[^447] [Golf](Golf "wikilink"),
[netball](netball "wikilink"), [tennis](tennis "wikilink") and
[cricket](cricket "wikilink") have the highest rates of adult
participation, while netball, rugby union and [football
(soccer)](association_football "wikilink") are particularly popular
among young people.[^448][^449] [Horse
racing](Thoroughbred_racing_in_New_Zealand "wikilink") is one of the
most popular [spectator sports](spectator_sport "wikilink") in New
Zealand and was part of the \"rugby, racing, and beer\" subculture
during the 1960s.[^450] Around 54% of New Zealand adolescents
participate in sports for their school.[^451] Victorious rugby tours to
Australia and the United Kingdom in the [late
1880s](188889_New_Zealand_Native_football_team "wikilink") and the
[early 1900s](The_Original_All_Blacks "wikilink") played an early role
in instilling a national identity.[^452] Mori participation in European
sports was particularly evident in rugby, and the country\'s team
performs a [haka](Haka_(sports) "wikilink"), a traditional Mori
challenge, before international matches.[^453] New Zealand is known for
its [extreme sports](extreme_sport "wikilink"), [adventure
tourism](Adventure_travel "wikilink")`{{sfn|Bain|2006|p=69}}`{=mediawiki}
and strong [mountaineering](mountaineering "wikilink") tradition, as
seen in the success of notable New Zealander [Sir Edmund
Hillary](Edmund_Hillary "wikilink").[^454][^455] Other outdoor pursuits
such as [cycling](cycling_in_New_Zealand "wikilink"), fishing, swimming,
running, [tramping](Tramping_in_New_Zealand "wikilink"), canoeing,
hunting, snowsports, surfing and sailing are also popular.[^456] New
Zealand has seen regular sailing success in the [America\'s
Cup](America's_Cup "wikilink") regatta since 1995.[^457] The Polynesian
sport of [waka ama](waka_ama "wikilink") racing has experienced a
resurgence of interest in New Zealand since the 1980s.[^458]

New Zealand has competitive international teams in [rugby
union](New_Zealand_national_rugby_union_team "wikilink"), [rugby
league](New_Zealand_national_rugby_league_team "wikilink"),
[netball](New_Zealand_national_netball_team "wikilink"),
[cricket](New_Zealand_national_cricket_team "wikilink"),
[softball](New_Zealand_men's_national_softball_team "wikilink"), and
[sailing](Team_New_Zealand "wikilink"). New Zealand participated at the
[Summer Olympics](Summer_Olympics "wikilink") in 1908 and 1912 as [a
joint team with Australia](Australasia_at_the_Olympics "wikilink"),
before first participating [on its
own](New_Zealand_at_the_Olympics "wikilink") in 1920.[^459] The country
has ranked highly on a medals-to-population ratio at recent
Games.[^460][^461] The [All
Blacks](New_Zealand_national_rugby_union_team "wikilink"), the national
rugby union team, are the most successful in the history of
international rugby[^462] and have won the [World
Cup](Rugby_World_Cup "wikilink") three times.[^463]

### Cuisine

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|New Zealand cuisine}}
```
![Ingredients to be prepared for a
[hng](hng "wikilink")](Hangi_ingredients.jpg "Ingredients to be prepared for a hng")

The national cuisine has been described as [Pacific
Rim](Pacific_Rim "wikilink"), incorporating the native [Mori
cuisine](Mori_cuisine "wikilink") and diverse culinary traditions
introduced by settlers and immigrants from Europe, Polynesia, and
Asia.[^464] New Zealand yields produce from land and sea---most crops
and livestock, such as maize, potatoes and pigs, were gradually
introduced by the early European settlers.[^465] Distinctive ingredients
or dishes include [lamb](lamb_and_mutton "wikilink"), salmon,
`{{lang|mi|[[kura]]}}`{=mediawiki} (crayfish),[^466] [Bluff
oysters](Bluff_oyster "wikilink"), [whitebait](whitebait "wikilink"),
`{{lang|mi|[[pua]]}}`{=mediawiki} (abalone), mussels, scallops,
`{{lang|mi|[[Paphies australis|pipi]]}}`{=mediawiki} and
`{{lang|mi|[[tuatua]]}}`{=mediawiki} (types of New Zealand
shellfish),[^467] `{{lang|mi|[[kmara]]}}`{=mediawiki} (sweet potato),
[kiwifruit](kiwifruit "wikilink"), [tamarillo](tamarillo "wikilink"),
and [pavlova](Pavlova_(cake) "wikilink") (considered a national
dessert).[^468][^469] A [hng](hng "wikilink") is a traditional Mori
method of cooking food using heated rocks buried in a pit oven; still
used for large groups on special occasions,[^470] such as
*[tangihanga](tangihanga "wikilink")*.[^471]

The **United States of America** (**USA** or **U.S.A.**), commonly known
as the **United States** (**US** or **U.S.**) or **America**, is a
country primarily located in [North America](North_America "wikilink"),
between [Canada](Canada "wikilink") and [Mexico](Mexico "wikilink"). It
is a [federation](Federalism_in_the_United_States "wikilink") of 50
[states](U.S._state "wikilink"), a [federal capital
district](Federal_district_of_the_United_States "wikilink")
([Washington, D.C.](Washington,_D.C. "wikilink")), and 326 [Indian
reservations](Indian_reservation "wikilink"). Outside the union of
states, it asserts sovereignty over five major [unincorporated island
territories](Territories_of_the_United_States "wikilink") and various
[uninhabited
islands](United_States_Minor_Outlying_Islands "wikilink").`{{efn|The five major territories outside the union of states are [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]]. The seven undisputed island areas without permanent populations are [[Baker Island]], [[Howland Island]], [[Jarvis Island]], [[Johnston Atoll]], [[Kingman Reef]], [[Midway Atoll]], and [[Palmyra Atoll]].

million.`{{efn|The [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]]'s 2023 estimate was 334,914,895 residents. All official population figures are for the 50 states and the District of Columbia; they exclude the five major U.S. territories and outlying islands.

[Paleo-Indians](Paleo-Indians "wikilink") migrated across the [Bering
land bridge](Bering_land_bridge "wikilink") more than 12,000 years ago.
[British colonization](British_colonization_of_the_Americas "wikilink")
led to the first settlement of the [Thirteen
Colonies](Thirteen_Colonies "wikilink") in
[Virginia](Virginia_Colony "wikilink") in 1607. Clashes with the
[British Crown](The_Crown "wikilink") over taxation and [political
representation](No_taxation_without_representation "wikilink") sparked
the [American Revolution](American_Revolution "wikilink"), with the
[Second Continental Congress](Second_Continental_Congress "wikilink")
formally [declaring
independence](United_States_Declaration_of_Independence "wikilink") on
July 4, 1776. Following its victory in the [Revolutionary
War](American_Revolutionary_War "wikilink") (1775--1783), the country
continued to [expand across North
America](Territorial_evolution_of_the_United_States "wikilink"). As more
[states were admitted](Admission_to_the_Union "wikilink"), sectional
division over [slavery](Slavery_in_the_United_States "wikilink") led to
the secession of the [Confederate States of
America](Confederate_States_of_America "wikilink"), which fought the
remaining states of the [Union](Union_(American_Civil_War) "wikilink")
during the 1861--1865 [American Civil
War](American_Civil_War "wikilink"). With the Union\'s victory and
preservation, [slavery was abolished
nationally](Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "wikilink").
By 1900, the United States had established itself as a [great
power](great_power "wikilink"), becoming the world\'s [largest
economy](List_of_countries_by_largest_historical_GDP "wikilink"). After
[Japan](Empire_of_Japan "wikilink")\'s [attack on Pearl
Harbor](attack_on_Pearl_Harbor "wikilink") in December 1941, the U.S.

## Etymology

```{=mediawiki}
{{Further|Names of the United States|Demonyms for the United States}}
```
The first documentary evidence of the phrase \"United States of
America\" dates back to a letter from January 2, 1776, written by
[Stephen Moylan](Stephen_Moylan "wikilink"), a [Continental
Army](Continental_Army "wikilink") aide to General [George
Washington](George_Washington "wikilink"), to [Joseph
Reed](Joseph_Reed_(politician) "wikilink"), Washington\'s
[aide-de-camp](aide-de-camp "wikilink"). Moylan expressed his desire to
go \"with full and ample powers from the United States of America to
Spain\" to seek assistance in the [Revolutionary
War](American_Revolutionary_War "wikilink") effort.[^1][^2] The first
known publication of the phrase \"United States of America\" was in an
anonymous essay in *[The Virginia
Gazette](The_Virginia_Gazette "wikilink")* newspaper in
[Williamsburg](Williamsburg,_Virginia "wikilink"), on April 6, 1776.[^3]

By June 1776, the name \"United States of America\" appeared in drafts
of the [Articles of Confederation](Articles_of_Confederation "wikilink")
and [Perpetual Union](Perpetual_Union "wikilink"), authored by [John
Dickinson](John_Dickinson "wikilink"), a [Founding
Father](Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States "wikilink") from the
[Province of
Pennsylvania](Province_of_Pennsylvania "wikilink"),`{{sfn|Safire|2003|p=199}}`{=mediawiki}`{{sfn|Mostert|2005|p=18}}`{=mediawiki}
and in the [Declaration of
Independence](United_States_Declaration_of_Independence "wikilink"),
written primarily by [Thomas Jefferson](Thomas_Jefferson "wikilink") and
adopted by the [Second Continental
Congress](Second_Continental_Congress "wikilink") in
[Philadelphia](Philadelphia "wikilink"), on July 4,
1776.`{{sfn|Safire|2003|p=199}}`{=mediawiki}[^4]

[Christopher Columbus](Christopher_Columbus "wikilink") began exploring
the [Caribbean](Caribbean "wikilink") in 1492, leading to
[Spanish](Spanish_Empire "wikilink") settlements in present-day Puerto
Rico, Florida, and [New Mexico](New_Mexico "wikilink").[^9][^10][^11]
[France](Kingdom_of_France "wikilink") established [its own

River](Mississippi_River "wikilink") and [Gulf of
Mexico](Gulf_of_Mexico "wikilink").[^12] [British
colonization](British_colonization_of_the_Americas "wikilink") of the
[East Coast](East_Coast_of_the_United_States "wikilink") began with the
[Virginia Colony](Colony_of_Virginia "wikilink") (1607) and [Plymouth
Colony](Plymouth_Colony "wikilink") (1620).[^13][^14] The [Mayflower
Compact](Mayflower_Compact "wikilink") and the [Fundamental Orders of
Connecticut](Fundamental_Orders_of_Connecticut "wikilink") established
precedents for representative
[self-governance](self-governance "wikilink") and
[constitutionalism](constitutionalism "wikilink") that would develop
throughout the American colonies.[^15][^16]

While European settlers in what is now the United States experienced
conflicts with Native Americans, they also engaged in trade, exchanging
European tools for food and animal
pelts.[^17]`{{efn|From the late 15th century, the [[Columbian exchange]] had been catastrophic for native populations throughout the Americas.

The colonial authorities often pursued policies that forced Native
Americans to adopt European lifestyles, including conversion to
Christianity.[^18][^19] Although many native peoples accepted
Christianity and colonial culture, they still endured
[wars](American_Indian_Wars "wikilink"), [ethnic
cleansing](ethnic_cleansing "wikilink"), and [documented acts of
genocide](Native_American_genocide_in_the_United_States "wikilink").
Along the eastern seaboard, settlers [trafficked African
slaves](Slavery_in_the_colonial_history_of_the_United_States "wikilink")

trade](Atlantic_slave_trade "wikilink").[^20]

Britain](British_Empire "wikilink"),[^21] and had [local
governments](Colonial_government_in_the_Thirteen_Colonies "wikilink")
with elections open to most white male property owners.[^22][^23] The
colonial population grew rapidly, eclipsing Native American
populations;[^24] by the 1770s, the natural increase of the population
was such that only a small minority of Americans had been born
overseas.[^25] The colonies\' distance from Britain allowed for the
development of self-governance,[^26] and the [First Great
Awakening](First_Great_Awakening "wikilink")---a series of [Christian
revivals](Christian_revival "wikilink")---fueled colonial interest in
[religious liberty](Freedom_of_religion "wikilink").[^27]

After winning the [French and Indian
War](French_and_Indian_War "wikilink"), Britain began to assert greater
control over local colonial affairs, creating [colonial political
resistance](American_Revolution "wikilink"); one of the primary colonial
grievances was a denial of their [rights as
Englishmen](Rights_of_Englishmen "wikilink"), particularly the right to
[representation in the British government that taxed
them](No_taxation_without_representation "wikilink"). In 1774, the
[First Continental Congress](First_Continental_Congress "wikilink") met
in [Philadelphia](Philadelphia "wikilink"), and passed a [colonial
boycott of British goods](Continental_Association "wikilink") that
proved effective. The British attempt to then disarm the colonists
resulted in the 1775 [Battles of Lexington and
Concord](Battles_of_Lexington_and_Concord "wikilink"), igniting the
[American Revolutionary War](American_Revolutionary_War "wikilink"). At
the [Second Continental
Congress](Second_Continental_Congress "wikilink"), the colonies
appointed [George Washington](George_Washington "wikilink")
commander-in-chief of the [Continental
Army](Continental_Army "wikilink") and created [a
committee](Committee_of_Five "wikilink") led by [Thomas
Jefferson](Thomas_Jefferson "wikilink") to write the [Declaration of
Independence](United_States_Declaration_of_Independence "wikilink"),
adopted on July 4, 1776.[^28] The political values of the American
Revolution included [liberty](liberty "wikilink")*,* [inalienable
individual rights](Natural_rights_and_legal_rights "wikilink"); and the
[sovereignty of the people](Popular_sovereignty "wikilink");[^29]
supporting
[republicanism](Republicanism_in_the_United_States "wikilink") and
rejecting [monarchy](monarchy "wikilink"),
[aristocracy](aristocracy "wikilink"), and hereditary political power;
virtue and faithfulness in the performance of civic duties; and
vilification of [corruption](corruption "wikilink").[^30] The [Founding
Fathers of the United
States](Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States "wikilink"), which
included George Washington, [Benjamin
Franklin](Benjamin_Franklin "wikilink"), [Alexander
Hamilton](Alexander_Hamilton "wikilink"), [Thomas
Jefferson](Thomas_Jefferson "wikilink"), [John
Jay](John_Jay "wikilink"), [James Madison](James_Madison "wikilink"),
[Thomas Paine](Thomas_Paine "wikilink"), and [John
Adams](John_Adams "wikilink"), took inspiration from Ancient
[Greco-Roman](Greco-Roman_world "wikilink"),
[Renaissance](Renaissance "wikilink"), and [Age of
Enlightenment](Age_of_Enlightenment "wikilink") philosophies and
ideas.[^31][^32]

After the British surrender at the [siege of
Yorktown](siege_of_Yorktown "wikilink") in 1781, American sovereignty
was internationally recognized by the [Treaty of Paris
(1783)](Treaty_of_Paris_(1783) "wikilink"), through which the U.S.
gained territory stretching west to the Mississippi River, north to
present-day Canada, and south to [Spanish
Florida](Spanish_Florida "wikilink").[^33] Ratified in 1781, the
[Articles of Confederation](Articles_of_Confederation "wikilink")
established a decentralized government that operated until 1789.[^34]
The [Northwest Ordinance](Northwest_Ordinance "wikilink") (1787)
established the precedent by which the country\'s territory would expand
with the [admission of new states](Admission_to_the_Union "wikilink"),
rather than the expansion of existing states.[^35] The [U.S.
Constitution](Constitution_of_the_United_States "wikilink") was drafted
at the 1787 [Constitutional
Convention](Constitutional_Convention_(United_States) "wikilink") to
overcome the limitations of the Articles; it went into effect in 1789,
creating a federation administered by [three
branches](Separation_of_powers "wikilink") on the principle of [checks
and
balances](checks_and_balances "wikilink").`{{sfn|Foner|2020|p=524}}`{=mediawiki}
Washington [was

In the late 18th century, American settlers began to [expand
westward](Territorial_evolution_of_the_United_States "wikilink"), some
with a sense of [manifest destiny](manifest_destiny "wikilink").[^37]
The [Louisiana Purchase](Louisiana_Purchase "wikilink") (1803) from
France nearly doubled the territory of the United States.[^38]
[Lingering issues with Britain
remained](Origins_of_the_War_of_1812 "wikilink"), leading to the [War of
1812](War_of_1812 "wikilink"), which was fought to a draw.[^39] [Spain
ceded Florida](AdamsOns_Treaty "wikilink") and its Gulf Coast
territory in 1819.[^40] The [Missouri
Compromise](Missouri_Compromise "wikilink") attempted to balance desires
of northern states to prevent expansion of slavery in the country with
those of southern states to expand it, admitting
[Missouri](Missouri "wikilink") as a [slave
state](Slave_states_and_free_states "wikilink") and
[Maine](Maine#Statehood "wikilink") as a free state and declared a
policy of prohibiting slavery in the remaining Louisiana Purchase lands
north of the [3630 parallel](parallel_3630_north "wikilink").[^41]
As Americans expanded further into land inhabited by Native Americans,
the federal government often applied
[policies](Federal_Indian_Policy "wikilink") of [Indian
removal](Indian_removal "wikilink") or
[assimilation](Cultural_assimilation_of_Native_Americans "wikilink").[^42][^43]
The infamous [Trail of Tears](Trail_of_Tears "wikilink") (1830--1850)
was a U.S. government policy that forcibly removed and displaced most
Native Americans living east of the [Mississippi
River](Mississippi_River "wikilink") to lands far to the west. These and
earlier organized displacements prompted a long series of [American
Indian Wars](American_Indian_Wars "wikilink") west of the
Mississippi.[^44][^45] The [Republic of
Texas](Republic_of_Texas "wikilink") was
[annexed](Texas_annexation "wikilink") in 1845,[^46] and the 1846
[Oregon Treaty](Oregon_Treaty "wikilink") led to U.S. control of the
present-day [American
Northwest](Northwestern_United_States "wikilink").[^47] Victory in the
[Mexican--American War](MexicanAmerican_War "wikilink") resulted in the
1848 [Mexican Cession](Mexican_Cession "wikilink") of California and
much of the present-day [American
Southwest](Southwestern_United_States "wikilink").[^48][^49] The
[California Gold Rush](California_Gold_Rush "wikilink") of 1848--1849
spurred a huge migration of white settlers to the Pacific coast, leading
to even more confrontations with Native populations. One of the most
violent, the [California genocide](California_genocide "wikilink") of
thousands of Native inhabitants, lasted into the early 1870s,[^50][^51]
just as additional western territories and states were created.[^52]

[Jewish](History_of_the_Jews_in_the_United_States "wikilink"),
[Irish](Irish_Americans "wikilink"), and
[Italian](Italian_Americans "wikilink") populations, while many
[Germans](German_Americans "wikilink") and Central Europeans moved to
the [Midwest](Midwestern_United_States "wikilink"). At the same time,
about one million [French
Canadians](French-Canadian_Americans "wikilink") migrated from
[Quebec](Quebec "wikilink") to [New
England](New_England "wikilink").[^67] During the [Great
Migration](Great_Migration_(African_American) "wikilink"), millions of
African Americans [left the rural South](Jim_Crow_economy "wikilink")
for urban areas in the North.[^68] Alaska was
[purchased](Alaska_Purchase "wikilink") from
[Russia](Russian_Empire "wikilink") in 1867.[^69]

The [Compromise of 1877](Compromise_of_1877 "wikilink") effectively
ended Reconstruction and [white supremacists took local control of
Southern politics](Redeemers "wikilink").[^70][^71] African Americans
endured a period of heightened, overt racism following Reconstruction, a
time often called the [nadir of American race
relations](nadir_of_American_race_relations "wikilink").[^72][^73] A
series of Supreme Court decisions, including [Plessy v.
Ferguson](Plessy_v._Ferguson "wikilink"), emptied the Fourteenth and
Fifteenth Amendments of their force, allowing [Jim Crow
laws](Jim_Crow_laws "wikilink") in the South to remain unchecked,
[sundown towns](sundown_town "wikilink") in the Midwest, and
[segregation](racial_segregation_in_the_United_States "wikilink") in
cities across the country, which would be reinforced by the policy of
[redlining](redlining "wikilink") later adopted by the federal [Home
Owners\' Loan
Corporation](Home_Owners'_Loan_Corporation "wikilink").[^74]

[An explosion of technological
advancement](Second_Industrial_Revolution "wikilink") accompanied by the
exploitation of cheap immigrant labor[^75] led to [rapid economic
development](Gilded_Age "wikilink") during the late 19th and early 20th
centuries, allowing the United States to outpace England, France, and
Germany combined.[^76][^77] This fostered the amassing of power by [a
few prominent industrialists](Robber_baron_(industrialist) "wikilink"),
largely by their formation of [trusts](Trust_(business) "wikilink") and
[monopolies](Monopoly "wikilink") to prevent competition.[^78]
[Tycoons](Tycoon "wikilink") led the nation\'s expansion in the
[railroad](History_of_rail_transportation_in_the_United_States "wikilink"),
[petroleum](History_of_the_petroleum_industry_in_the_United_States "wikilink"),
and [steel](History_of_the_steel_industry_(18501970) "wikilink")
industries. The United States emerged as a pioneer of the [automotive
industry](Automotive_industry_in_the_United_States "wikilink").[^79]
These changes were accompanied by significant increases in [economic
inequality](economic_inequality "wikilink"), [slum
conditions](How_the_Other_Half_Lives "wikilink"), and [social
unrest](List_of_incidents_of_civil_unrest_in_the_United_States "wikilink"),
creating the environment for [labor unions to begin to
flourish](Labor_history_of_the_United_States "wikilink").[^80][^81][^82]
This period eventually ended with the advent of the [Progressive
Era](Progressive_Era "wikilink"), which was characterized by significant
reforms.[^83][^84]

the roles of women partly resulted in large increases in female labor
participation in the 1970s, and by 1985 the majority of women aged 16
and older were employed.[^107] The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the

Columbia](Contiguous_United_States "wikilink") occupy a combined area of
`{{convert|3,119,885|sqmi|km2|abbr=}}`{=mediawiki}.[^122][^123] The
[coastal plain](Atlantic_coastal_plain "wikilink") of the
[Atlantic](Atlantic_Ocean "wikilink") seaboard gives way to inland
forests and rolling hills in the
[Piedmont](Piedmont_(United_States) "wikilink") plateau region.[^124]

The [Appalachian Mountains](Appalachian_Mountains "wikilink") and the
[Adirondack](Adirondack_Mountains "wikilink") massif separate the East
Coast from the [Great Lakes](Great_Lakes "wikilink") and the grasslands
of the [Midwest](Midwestern_United_States "wikilink").[^125] The
[Mississippi River System](Mississippi_River_System "wikilink")---the
world\'s [fourth longest river
system](List_of_rivers_by_length "wikilink")---runs mainly north--south
through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile

California](coastal_California "wikilink"), and
[oceanic](oceanic_climate "wikilink") in coastal
[Oregon](Oregon "wikilink"),
[Washington](Washington_(state) "wikilink"), and southern Alaska. Most
of Alaska is [subarctic](Subarctic_climate "wikilink") or
[polar](Polar_climate "wikilink"). Hawaii and the southern tip of
Florida are [tropical](Tropical_climate "wikilink"), as well as its
territories in the [Caribbean](Caribbean "wikilink") and the
Pacific.[^135]

States bordering the [Gulf of Mexico](Gulf_of_Mexico "wikilink") are
prone to [hurricanes](Tropical_cyclone "wikilink"), and most of the
world\'s [tornadoes](Tornadoes_in_the_United_States "wikilink") occur in
the country, mainly in [Tornado Alley](Tornado_Alley "wikilink").[^136]
Overall, the United States receives more high-impact extreme weather
incidents than any other country.[^137] Extreme weather became more
frequent in the U.S. in the 21st century, with three times the number of
reported [heat waves](heat_waves "wikilink") as in the 1960s. In the

    become law (subject to congressional override), and appoints the
    [members of the Cabinet](Cabinet_of_the_United_States "wikilink")
    (subject to Senate approval) and other officials, who administer and
    enforce federal laws and policies through their respective
    [agencies](List_of_federal_agencies_in_the_United_States "wikilink").[^166]
    The president and the vice president run and are elected together in
    a presidential election. Unlike any others in American politics, it
    is an [indirect election](indirect_election "wikilink"), with the
    winner being determined by votes cast by electors of the [Electoral
    College](United_States_Electoral_College "wikilink"). The President
    and Vice President serve a four-year term and may be elected to the
    office [no more than
    twice](Term_limits_in_the_United_States "wikilink").[^167]
-   The [U.S. federal
    judiciary](Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States "wikilink"), whose
    judges are all appointed for life by the President with Senate
    approval, consists primarily of the [U.S. Supreme
    Court](Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States "wikilink"), the [U.S.
    courts of appeals](United_States_courts_of_appeals "wikilink"), and
    the [U.S. district courts](United_States_district_court "wikilink").
    The U.S. Supreme Court interprets laws and overturn those they find
    [unconstitutional](constitutionality "wikilink").[^168] The Supreme
    Court is led by the [chief justice of the United
    States](Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States "wikilink"). It has nine
    members who serve for life. The members are appointed by the sitting
    president when a vacancy becomes available.[^169]

The three-branch system is known as the [presidential
system](presidential_system "wikilink"), in contrast to the
[parliamentary system](parliamentary_system "wikilink"), where the
executive is part of the legislative body. Many countries around the
world copied this aspect of the 1789 [Constitution of the United
States](Constitution_of_the_United_States "wikilink"), especially in the
Americas.[^170]

The Constitution is silent on political parties. However, they developed
independently in the 18th century with the
[Federalist](Federalist_Party "wikilink") and
[Anti-Federalist](Anti-Federalist_Party "wikilink") parties.[^171] Since
then, the United States has operated as a de facto [two-party
system](two-party_system "wikilink"), though the parties in that system
have been different at different times.

The two main national parties are presently the
[Democratic](Democratic_Party_(United_States) "wikilink") and the
[Republican](Republican_Party_(United_States) "wikilink"). The former is
perceived as [relatively
liberal](Liberalism_in_the_United_States "wikilink") in its political
platform while the latter is perceived as [relatively
conservative](Conservatism_in_the_United_States "wikilink").[^172] Each
has a [primary system](United_States_presidential_primary "wikilink") to
nominate a [presidential ticket](Ticket_(election) "wikilink"), and each
runs candidates for other offices in every state in the Union. [Other
smaller and less influential parties
exist](Third_party_(U.S._politics) "wikilink") but do not have the
national scope and breadth of the two main parties.

In [the American federal
system](Federalism_in_the_United_States "wikilink"), sovereign powers
are shared between two levels of elected government: national and state.
People in the states are also represented by local elected governments,
which are administrative divisions of the states.[^173] States are
subdivided into [counties or county
equivalents](Counties_of_the_United_States "wikilink"), and [further
divided into
municipalities](Local_government_in_the_United_States "wikilink"). The
District of Columbia is a [federal
district](federal_district "wikilink") that contains the capital of the
United States, the [city of
Washington](Washington,_D.C. "wikilink").[^174] The territories and the
District of Columbia are administrative divisions of the federal

United States is a member of the [G7](G7 "wikilink"),[^178]
[G20](G20 "wikilink"),[^179] and [OECD](OECD "wikilink")
intergovernmental organizations.[^180] Almost all countries have
[embassies](List_of_diplomatic_missions_in_the_United_States "wikilink")
and many have [consulates](consul_(representative) "wikilink") (official
representatives) in the country. Likewise, nearly all countries host
formal [diplomatic missions](diplomatic_mission "wikilink") with the
United States, except
[Iran](IranUnited_States_relations "wikilink"),[^181] [North
Korea](North_KoreaUnited_States_relations "wikilink"),[^182] and
[Bhutan](Foreign_relations_of_Bhutan#Other_countries "wikilink").[^183]
Though [Taiwan](TaiwanUnited_States_relations "wikilink") does not have
formal diplomatic relations with the U.S., it maintains close unofficial
relations.[^184] The United States regularly supplies Taiwan with
[military equipment](Six_Assurances "wikilink") to deter potential
Chinese aggression.[^185] Its geopolitical attention also turned to the
[Indo-Pacific](Indo-Pacific "wikilink") when the United States joined
the [Quadrilateral Security
Dialogue](Quadrilateral_Security_Dialogue "wikilink") with Australia,
India, and Japan.[^186]

The United States has a \"[Special

Kingdom](United_KingdomUnited_States_relations "wikilink")[^187] and
strong ties [with
Canada](CanadaUnited_States_relations "wikilink"),[^188]

works closely with its [NATO](NATO "wikilink") allies on military and
[national security](national_security "wikilink") issues, and with
countries in the Americas through the [Organization of American
States](Organization_of_American_States "wikilink") and the [United
States--Mexico--Canada Free Trade
Agreement](United_StatesMexicoCanada_Agreement "wikilink"). In South
America, [Colombia](Colombia "wikilink") is traditionally considered to
be the closest ally of the United States.[^196] The U.S. exercises full
international defense authority and responsibility for
[Micronesia](Federated_States_of_Micronesia "wikilink"), the [Marshall
Islands](Marshall_Islands "wikilink"), and [Palau](Palau "wikilink")
through the [Compact of Free
Association](Compact_of_Free_Association "wikilink").[^197] It has
increasingly conducted strategic cooperation [with
India](IndiaUnited_States_relations "wikilink"),[^198] but its [ties
with China](ChinaUnited_States_relations "wikilink") have steadily
deteriorated.[^199][^200] Since 2014, the U.S. has become a [key ally of
Ukraine](UkraineUnited_States_relations "wikilink");[^201] it has also
provided the country with significant military equipment and other
support in response to Russia\'s 2022 invasion.[^202]

practice varies significantly by region.[^335] \"[Ceremonial
deism](Ceremonial_deism "wikilink")\" is common in American
culture.[^336]

The overwhelming majority of [Americans](Americans "wikilink") believe
in a [higher power](Higher_Power "wikilink") or spiritual force, engage
in [spiritual practices](spiritual_practice "wikilink") such as prayer,
and consider themselves religious or
[spiritual](Spirituality "wikilink").[^337][^338] In the \"[Bible

States, [evangelical Protestantism](Evangelicalism "wikilink") plays a

About 82% of Americans live in [urban
areas](United_States_urban_area "wikilink"), including suburbs;[^341]
about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000.[^342]
In 2022, 333 [incorporated

According to the [Centers for Disease
Control](Centers_for_Disease_Control "wikilink") (CDC), average American
life expectancy at birth was 77.5 years in 2022 (74.8 years for men and
80.2 years for women). This was a gain of 1.1 years from 76.4 years in
2021, but the CDC noted that the new average \"didn\'t fully offset the
loss of 2.4 years between 2019 and 2021\". The [COVID
pandemic](COVID_pandemic "wikilink") and higher overall mortality due to
opioid overdoses and suicides were held mostly responsible for the
previous drop in life expectancy.[^351] The same report stated that the
2022 gains in average U.S. life expectancy were especially significant
for men, Hispanics, and American Indian--Alaskan Native people
([AIAN](AIAN "wikilink")). Starting in 1998, the life expectancy in the
U.S. fell behind that of [other wealthy industrialized
countries](List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy "wikilink"), and
Americans\' \"health disadvantage\" gap has been increasing ever
since.[^352] The U.S. has one of the highest
[suicide](Suicide_in_the_United_States "wikilink") rates among
[high-income countries](high-income_countries "wikilink").[^353]
Approximately one-third of the U.S. adult population is obese and
another third is overweight.[^354] The U.S. healthcare system far
[outspends](List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_(PPP)_per_capita "wikilink")
that of any other country, measured both in per capita spending and as a
percentage of GDP, but attains worse healthcare outcomes when compared
to peer countries for reasons that are debated.[^355] The United States
is the only developed country [without a system of universal
healthcare](Healthcare_reform_in_the_United_States "wikilink"), and a
[significant proportion of the population that does not carry health
insurance](Health_insurance_coverage_in_the_United_States "wikilink").[^356]
Government-funded healthcare coverage for the poor
([Medicaid](Medicaid "wikilink")) and for those age 65 and older
([Medicare](Medicare_(United_States) "wikilink")) is available to
Americans who meet the programs\' income or age qualifications. In 2010,

American [K-12
education](K12_education_in_the_United_States "wikilink") is operated
by state and local governments and regulated by the [United States
Department of
Education](United_States_Department_of_Education "wikilink") through
restrictions on federal
grants.`{{original research inline|date=January 2024}}`{=mediawiki} In
most states, children are required to attend school from the age of five
or six (beginning with [kindergarten](kindergarten "wikilink") or [first
grade](first_grade "wikilink")) until they turn 18 (generally bringing
them through [twelfth grade](twelfth_grade "wikilink"), the end of high
school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.[^358]
The U.S. spends more on education per student than any country in the
world,[^359] spending an average of \$12,794 per year on public
elementary and secondary school students in the 2016--2017 school
year.[^360] Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school,
52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a [bachelor\'s
degree](bachelor's_degree "wikilink"), and 9.6% earned graduate
degrees.[^361] The basic
[literacy](Literacy_in_the_United_States "wikilink") rate is

winners](List_of_Nobel_laureates_by_country "wikilink") in history, with
411 (having won 413 awards).[^364][^365]

The [United States tertiary
education](Higher_education_in_the_United_States "wikilink") is
primarily through the [state university
system](state_university_system "wikilink"), though many [private
universities and colleges](Private_university "wikilink") serve about
20% of students. Large amounts of [federal student financial
aid](Student_financial_aid_in_the_United_States "wikilink") are provided
in the form of grants and loans.

Colleges and universities directly funded by the federal government are
limited to military personnel and government employees and include the
[United States service
academies](United_States_service_academies "wikilink"), [Naval
Postgraduate School](Naval_Postgraduate_School "wikilink"), and
[military staff colleges](US_military_staff_colleges "wikilink"). Many
of the world\'s top universities, as listed by various ranking
organizations, are in the United States, including 19 of the top
25.[^366][^367] There are local [community
colleges](community_college "wikilink") with generally more open
admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition.[^368]

As for [public expenditures](public_expenditure "wikilink") on higher
education, the U.S. spends more per student than the
[OECD](OECD "wikilink") average, and more than all nations in combined
public and private spending.[^369] Despite some student [loan
forgiveness](loan_forgiveness "wikilink") programs in place,[^370]
[student loan debt](Student_debt "wikilink") has increased by 102% in
the last decade,[^371] and exceeded 1.7 trillion dollars as of

Americans have traditionally [been
characterized](Stereotypes_of_Americans "wikilink") by a unifying
political belief in an \"[American
creed](American_civil_religion "wikilink")\" emphasizing liberty,
[equality under the law](equality_under_the_law "wikilink"), democracy,
[social equality](social_equality "wikilink"), [property
rights](property_rights "wikilink"), and a preference for [limited
government](limited_government "wikilink").[^375][^376] Culturally, the
country has been described as having the values of
[individualism](individualism "wikilink") and [personal
autonomy](Left-libertarianism#Personal_autonomy "wikilink"),[^377][^378]
having a strong [work ethic](work_ethic "wikilink"),[^379]
[competitiveness](Competition "wikilink"),[^380] and voluntary
[altruism](altruism "wikilink") towards others.[^381][^382][^383]
According to a 2016 study by the [Charities Aid
Foundation](Charities_Aid_Foundation "wikilink"), Americans donated
1.44% of total GDP to charity, the [highest

by a large margin.[^384] The United States is home to a [wide variety

It has acquired significant cultural and economic [soft

Nearly all present Americans or their ancestors came from [Europe,
Africa, and Asia](Afro-Eurasia "wikilink") (\"the [Old
World](Old_World "wikilink")\") within the past five centuries.[^387]
[Mainstream](wikt:mainstream "wikilink") American culture is a [Western
culture](Western_culture "wikilink") largely derived from the
[traditions of European immigrants](European_American "wikilink") with
influences from many other sources, such as [traditions brought by
slaves from Africa](African-American_culture "wikilink").[^388] More
recent immigration from [Asia](Asian_American "wikilink") and especially
[Latin America](Latin_American_culture "wikilink") has added to a
cultural mix that has been described as a homogenizing [melting
pot](melting_pot "wikilink"), and a heterogeneous [salad
bowl](salad_bowl_(cultural_idea) "wikilink"), with immigrants
contributing to, and often
[assimilating](Assimilation_(phonology) "wikilink") into, mainstream
American culture. The [American Dream](American_Dream "wikilink"), or
the perception that Americans enjoy high [social
mobility](Socio-economic_mobility_in_the_United_States "wikilink"),
plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[^389] Whether this perception
is accurate has been a topic of debate.[^390][^391][^392] While
mainstream culture holds that the United States is a [classless
society](classless_society "wikilink"),[^393] scholars identify
significant differences between [the country\'s social
classes](Social_class_in_the_United_States "wikilink"), affecting
[socialization](socialization "wikilink"), language, and values.[^394]
Americans tend to greatly value
[socioeconomic](socioeconomics "wikilink") achievement, but being
[ordinary or average](Average_Joe "wikilink") is promoted by some as a
noble condition as well.[^395]

The United States is considered to have the [strongest protections of
free speech of any
country](Freedom_of_speech_in_the_United_States "wikilink") under the

Colonial American authors were influenced by [John
Locke](John_Locke "wikilink") and various other Enlightenment
philosophers.`{{sfn|Baym|Levine|2013|pp=157-159}}`{=mediawiki}`{{sfn|Lauter|1994a|pp=503-509}}`{=mediawiki}
Before and shortly after the Revolutionary War, the newspaper rose to
prominence, filling a demand for anti-British national
literature.`{{sfn|Baym|Levine|2013|p=163}}`{=mediawiki}[^409] Led by
[Ralph Waldo Emerson](Ralph_Waldo_Emerson "wikilink") and [Margaret
Fuller](Margaret_Fuller "wikilink") in New
England,`{{sfn|Lauter|1994a|pp=1228-1229}}`{=mediawiki}
[transcendentalism](transcendentalism "wikilink") branched from
[Unitarianism](Unitarianism "wikilink") as the first major [American
philosophical movement](American_philosophy "wikilink").[^410][^411]
During the nineteenth-century [American
Renaissance](American_Renaissance_(literature) "wikilink"), writers like
[Walt Whitman](Walt_Whitman "wikilink") and [Harriet Beecher
Stowe](Harriet_Beecher_Stowe "wikilink") established a distinctive
American literary
tradition.`{{sfn|Baym|Levine|2013|pp=444-447}}`{=mediawiki}`{{sfn|Lauter|1994a|pp=1228, 1233, 1260}}`{=mediawiki}
As literacy rates rose, periodicals published more stories centered
around industrial workers, women, and the rural
poor.`{{sfn|Baym|Levine|2013|pp=1269-1270}}`{=mediawiki}`{{sfn|Lauter|1994b|pp=8-10}}`{=mediawiki}
[Naturalism](Naturalism_(literature) "wikilink"),
[regionalism](American_literary_regionalism "wikilink"), and
[realism](Literary_realism#UnitedStates "wikilink")---the latter
associated with [Mark Twain](Mark_Twain "wikilink")---were the major
literary movements of the
period.`{{sfn|Baym|Levine|2013|pp=1271-1273}}`{=mediawiki}`{{sfn|Lauter|1994b|p=12}}`{=mediawiki}

While [modernism](Literary_modernism "wikilink") generally took on an
international character, modernist authors working within the United
States more often rooted their work in specific regions, peoples, and
cultures.`{{sfn|Baym|Levine|2013|pp=1850-1851}}`{=mediawiki} Following
the Great Migration to northern cities, African-American and black [West
Indian](West_Indian_Americans "wikilink") authors of the [Harlem
Renaissance](Harlem_Renaissance "wikilink") developed an independent
tradition of literature that rebuked a history of inequality and
celebrated black culture. An important cultural export during the [Jazz
Age](Jazz_Age "wikilink"), these writings were a key influence on the
[ngritude](ngritude "wikilink") philosophy.[^412][^413] In the 1950s,
an ideal of homogeneity led many authors to attempt to write the [Great
American
Novel](Great_American_Novel "wikilink"),`{{sfn|Baym|Levine|2013|pp=2260-2261}}`{=mediawiki}
while the [Beat Generation](Beat_Generation "wikilink") rejected this
conformity, using styles that elevated the impact of the [spoken
word](spoken_word "wikilink") over mechanics to describe drug use,
sexuality, and the failings of
society.`{{sfn|Baym|Levine|2013|p=2262}}`{=mediawiki}[^414] Contemporary
literature is more pluralistic than in previous eras, with the closest
thing to a unifying feature being a trend toward self-conscious
[experiments with

The United States is well known for its cinema and theater. Mainstream
theater in the United States derives from the old European theatrical
tradition and has been heavily influenced by the [British
theater](Theatre_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink").[^426] By the middle
of the 19th century America had created new distinct dramatic forms in
the [Tom Shows](Tom_Shows "wikilink"), the [showboat
theater](showboat "wikilink") and the [minstrel
show](minstrel_show "wikilink").[^427] The central [hub of the American
theater scene is Manhattan](Theater_District,_Manhattan "wikilink"),
with its divisions of [Broadway](Broadway_theatre "wikilink"),
[off-Broadway](off-Broadway "wikilink"), and
[off-off-Broadway](off-off-Broadway "wikilink").[^428]

Many movie and television [stars](Celebrity "wikilink") have gotten
their big break working in New York productions. Outside New York City,
many cities have professional [regional or resident theater
companies](Regional_theater_in_the_United_States "wikilink") that
produce their own seasons. The biggest-budget theatrical productions are
musicals. U.S. theater has an active [community
theater](community_theater "wikilink") culture.[^429]

The [Tony Awards](Tony_Awards "wikilink") recognizes excellence in live
Broadway theatre and are presented at an annual ceremony in

[parodied](parody "wikilink").[^431]](Grant_Wood_-_American_Gothic_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg "American Gothic (1930) by Grant Wood is one of the most famous American paintings and is widely parodied.")

In the visual arts, the [Hudson River
School](Hudson_River_School "wikilink") was a mid-19th-century movement
in the tradition of European [naturalism](Realism_(arts) "wikilink").
The 1913 [Armory Show](Armory_Show "wikilink") in New York City, an
exhibition of European [modernist art](modern_art "wikilink"), shocked
the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.[^433]

The tide of [modernism](modernism "wikilink") and then
[postmodernism](postmodernism "wikilink") has brought global fame to
American architects, including [Frank Lloyd
Wright](Frank_Lloyd_Wright "wikilink"), [Philip
Johnson](Philip_Johnson "wikilink"), and [Frank
Gehry](Frank_Gehry "wikilink").[^435] The [Metropolitan Museum of

```
[American folk music](American_folk_music "wikilink") encompasses
numerous music genres, variously known as traditional music, traditional
[folk music](folk_music "wikilink"), contemporary folk music, or roots
music. Many traditional songs have been sung within the same family or
folk group for generations, and sometimes trace back to such origins as
the [British Isles](British_Isles "wikilink"), [Mainland
Europe](Mainland_Europe "wikilink"), or
[Africa](African-American_music "wikilink").[^437] The rhythmic and
lyrical styles of African-American music in particular have influenced
American music.[^438] [Banjos](Banjo "wikilink") were brought to America
through the slave trade. [Minstrel shows](Minstrel_show "wikilink")
incorporating the instrument into their acts led to its increased
popularity and widespread production in the 19th
century.[^439]`{{sfn|Shi|2016|p=378}}`{=mediawiki} The [electric
guitar](electric_guitar "wikilink"), first invented in the 1930s, and
mass-produced by the 1940s, had an enormous influence on popular music,
in particular due to the development of [rock and
roll](rock_and_roll "wikilink").[^440] ![The [Country Music Hall of Fame

into [popular genres](popular_music "wikilink") with global audiences.
[Jazz](Jazz "wikilink") grew from blues and
[ragtime](ragtime "wikilink") in the early 20th century, developing from
the innovations and recordings of composers such as [W.C.
Handy](W.C._Handy "wikilink") and [Jelly Roll
Morton](Jelly_Roll_Morton "wikilink"). [Louis
Armstrong](Louis_Armstrong "wikilink") and [Duke
Ellington](Duke_Ellington "wikilink") increased its popularity early in
the 20th century.[^441] [Country music](Country_music "wikilink")
developed in the 1920s,[^442] rock and roll in the 1930s,[^443] and
[bluegrass](bluegrass_music "wikilink")[^444] and [rhythm and
blues](rhythm_and_blues "wikilink") in the
1940s.`{{sfn|OpenStax|2014|loc= [https://openstax.org/books/us-history/pages/28-4-popular-culture-and-mass-media 28.4]}}`{=mediawiki}

country\'s most celebrated songwriters.[^445] The musical forms of
[punk](Punk_rock "wikilink") and [hip hop](hip_hop "wikilink") both
originated in the United States in the 1970s.[^446]

The United States has the world\'s [largest music
market](List_of_largest_recorded_music_markets "wikilink") with a total
retail value of \$15.9 billion in 2022.[^447] Most of the world\'s
[major record companies](Record_label#Major_labels "wikilink") are based
in the U.S.; they are represented by the [Recording Industry Association
of America](Recording_Industry_Association_of_America "wikilink")
(RIAA).[^448] Mid-20th-century American [pop
stars](Popular_music "wikilink"), such as [Frank
Sinatra](Frank_Sinatra "wikilink")[^449] and [Elvis
Presley](Elvis_Presley "wikilink"),[^450] became [global

The United States and China collectively account for the majority of
global [apparel](apparel "wikilink") demand. Apart from professional
[business attire](business_attire "wikilink"), American fashion is
eclectic and predominantly informal. While Americans\' diverse cultural
roots are reflected in their clothing, [sneakers](sneaker "wikilink"),
[jeans](jeans "wikilink"), T-shirts, and [baseball
caps](baseball_cap "wikilink") are emblematic of American styles.[^457]
New York is considered to be one of the \"big four\" global [fashion
capitals](fashion_capital "wikilink"), along with Paris,
[Milan](Milan "wikilink"), and London. A study demonstrated that general
proximity to [Manhattan\'s Garment
District](Garment_District,_Manhattan "wikilink") has been synonymous
with American fashion since its inception in the early 20th
century.[^458]

The headquarters of many [designer labels](designer_label "wikilink")
reside in [Manhattan](Manhattan "wikilink"). Labels cater to [niche
markets](niche_market "wikilink"), such as pre teens. There has been a
trend in the United States fashion towards [sustainable

The U.S. film industry has a worldwide influence and following.
[Hollywood](Hollywood,_Los_Angeles "wikilink"), a district in northern
Los Angeles, the nation\'s second-most populous city, is also metonymous
for the American filmmaking industry, the third-largest in the world,
following [India](India "wikilink") and
[Nigeria](Nigeria "wikilink").[^461][^462][^463] The [major film
studios](major_film_studios "wikilink") of the United States are the
primary source of the [most commercially
successful](List_of_highest-grossing_films "wikilink") and most
ticket-selling movies in the world.[^464][^465] Since the early 20th
century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around
Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films
are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces
of globalization.[^466] The [Academy Awards](Academy_Awards "wikilink"),
popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the [Academy
of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences](Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences "wikilink") since

as the \"[Golden Age of
Hollywood](Classical_Hollywood_cinema "wikilink")\", from the early
sound period until the early 1960s,[^469] with screen actors such as
[John Wayne](John_Wayne "wikilink") and [Marilyn
Monroe](Marilyn_Monroe "wikilink") becoming iconic figures.[^470][^471]
In the 1970s, \"[New Hollywood](New_Hollywood "wikilink")\" or the
\"Hollywood Renaissance\"[^472] was defined by grittier films influenced
by French and Italian realist pictures of the [post-war
period](Aftermath_of_World_War_II "wikilink").[^473] The 21st century
was marked by the rise of American streaming platforms, which came to
rival traditional cinema.[^474][^475]

potatoes](sweet_potato "wikilink"), [corn](maize "wikilink"),
[squash](Cucurbita "wikilink"), and [maple
syrup](maple_syrup "wikilink"). Of the most enduring and pervasive
examples are variations of the native dish called
[succotash](succotash "wikilink"). Early settlers and later immigrants
combined these with foods they were familiar with, such as [wheat
flour](wheat_flour "wikilink"),[^476] beef, and milk to create a
distinctive American cuisine.[^477][^478] [New World

dishes](Mexican-American_cuisine "wikilink") such as
[burritos](burritos "wikilink") and [tacos](tacos "wikilink") preexisted
the United States in areas later annexed from Mexico, and [adaptations
of Chinese cuisine](American_Chinese_cuisine "wikilink") as well as
[pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian
sources](Italian-American_cuisine "wikilink") are all widely
consumed.[^484] American [chefs](chef "wikilink") have had a significant
impact on society both domestically and internationally. In 1946, the
[Culinary Institute of
America](Culinary_Institute_of_America "wikilink") was founded by
[Katharine Angell](Katharine_Cramer_Angell "wikilink") and [Frances

most prestigious culinary school, where many of the most talented
American chefs would study prior to successful careers.[^485][^486]

The [United States restaurant
industry](United_States_restaurant_industry "wikilink") was projected at
\$899 billion in sales for 2020,[^487][^488] and employed more than 15
million people, representing 10% of the nation\'s workforce
directly.[^489] It is the country\'s second-largest private employer and
the third-largest employer overall.[^490][^491] The United States is

restaurants, 70 of which are in New York City alone.[^492]
[Wine](American_wine "wikilink") has been produced in what is now the
United States since the 1500s, with the [first widespread production
beginning in what is now New Mexico](New_Mexico_wine "wikilink") in
1628.[^493][^494][^495] Today, wine production is undertaken in all
fifty states, with [California producing 84 percent of all US

[France](French_wine "wikilink").[^496][^497]

The American [fast-food](fast-food "wikilink") industry, the world\'s
first and largest, pioneered the
[drive-through](drive-through "wikilink") format in the 1940s[^498] and

![[American football](American_football "wikilink") is the most popular
sport in the United States; in this September 2022 [National Football
League](National_Football_League "wikilink") game, the [Jacksonville
Jaguars](Jacksonville_Jaguars "wikilink") play the [Washington
Commanders](Washington_Commanders "wikilink") at
[FedExField](FedExField "wikilink").](Commanders_vs._Jaguars_(52379056543).jpg "American football is the most popular sport in the United States; in this September 2022 National Football League game, the Jacksonville Jaguars play the Washington Commanders at FedExField.")

The most popular spectator sports in the U.S. are [American
football](American_football_in_the_United_States "wikilink"),
[basketball](Basketball_in_the_United_States "wikilink"),
[baseball](Baseball_in_the_United_States "wikilink"),
[soccer](Soccer_in_the_United_States "wikilink"), and [ice
hockey](Ice_hockey_in_the_United_States "wikilink").[^501] While most
major U.S. sports such as baseball and American football have evolved
out of European practices, basketball,
[volleyball](Volleyball_in_the_United_States "wikilink"),
[skateboarding](skateboarding "wikilink"), and
[snowboarding](snowboarding "wikilink") are American inventions, many of
which have become popular worldwide.[^502]
[Lacrosse](Lacrosse_in_the_United_States "wikilink") and
[surfing](Surfing_in_the_United_States "wikilink") arose from Native
American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate European
contact.[^503] The market for professional sports in the United States
was approximately \$69 billion in July 2013, roughly 50% larger than
that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[^504]

American football is by several measures the most popular spectator
sport in the United States;[^505] the [National Football
League](National_Football_League "wikilink") has the highest average
attendance of any sports league in the world, and the [Super
Bowl](Super_Bowl "wikilink") is watched by tens of millions
globally.[^506] However, baseball has been regarded as the U.S.
\"[national sport](national_sport "wikilink")\" since the late 19th
century. After American football, the next four most popular
professional team sports are basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice
hockey. Their premier leagues are, respectively, the [National
Basketball Association](National_Basketball_Association "wikilink"),
[Major League Baseball](Major_League_Baseball "wikilink"), [Major League
Soccer](Major_League_Soccer "wikilink"), and the [National Hockey
League](National_Hockey_League "wikilink"). The most-watched [individual
sports](individual_sport "wikilink") in the U.S. are
[golf](Golf_in_the_United_States "wikilink") and [auto
racing](auto_racing "wikilink"), particularly
[NASCAR](NASCAR "wikilink") and
[IndyCar](IndyCar "wikilink").[^507][^508]

On the [collegiate
level](College_athletics_in_the_United_States "wikilink"), earnings for
the member institutions exceed \$1 billion annually,[^509] and [college
football](college_football "wikilink") and
[basketball](College_basketball "wikilink") attract large audiences, as
the [NCAA March Madness
tournament](NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament "wikilink") and
the [College Football Playoff](College_Football_Playoff "wikilink") are
some of the most watched national sporting events.[^510] In the U.S.,
the intercollegiate sports level serves as a feeder system for
professional sports. This differs greatly from practices in nearly all
other countries, where publicly and privately funded sports
organizations serve this function.[^511]

Eight [Olympic Games](Olympic_Games "wikilink") have taken place in the
United States. The [1904 Summer
Olympics](1904_Summer_Olympics "wikilink") in [St.
Louis](St._Louis "wikilink"), [Missouri](Missouri "wikilink"), were the
first-ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.[^512] The Olympic Games
will be held in the U.S. for a ninth time when Los Angeles hosts the
[2028 Summer Olympics](2028_Summer_Olympics "wikilink"). [U.S.
athletes](United_States_at_the_Olympics "wikilink") have won a total of
2,959 medals (1,173 gold) at the Olympic Games, the most of any
country.[^513][^514][^515]

In international competition, the U.S. [men\'s national soccer
team](United_States_men's_national_soccer_team "wikilink") has qualified
for [eleven World Cups](United_States_at_the_FIFA_World_Cup "wikilink"),
while the [women\'s national
team](United_States_women's_national_soccer_team "wikilink") has
[won](United_States_at_the_FIFA_Women's_World_Cup "wikilink") the [FIFA
Women\'s World Cup](FIFA_Women's_World_Cup "wikilink") and [Olympic
soccer tournament](Football_at_the_Summer_Olympics "wikilink") four
times each.[^516] The United States hosted the [1994 FIFA World
Cup](1994_FIFA_World_Cup "wikilink") and will co-host, along with Canada
and Mexico, the [2026 FIFA World
Cup](2026_FIFA_World_Cup "wikilink").[^517] The [1999 FIFA Women\'s
World Cup](1999_FIFA_Women's_World_Cup "wikilink") was also hosted by
the United States. Its [final
match](1999_FIFA_Women's_World_Cup_final "wikilink") was watched by
90,185, setting the world record for most-attended women\'s sporting
event.[^518]

**Canada** is a country in [North America](North_America "wikilink").
Its [ten provinces and three
territories](Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada "wikilink") extend from
the [Atlantic Ocean](Atlantic_Ocean "wikilink") to the [Pacific
Ocean](Pacific_Ocean "wikilink") and northward into the [Arctic
Ocean](Arctic_Ocean "wikilink"), making it the world\'s [second-largest
country by total
area](List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area "wikilink"), with the
[world\'s longest
coastline](List_of_countries_by_length_of_coastline "wikilink"). [Its
border with the United States](CanadaUnited_States_border "wikilink")
is the world\'s longest international land border. The country is
characterized by a wide range of both
[meteorologic](Temperature_in_Canada "wikilink") and
[geological](Geography_of_Canada "wikilink") regions. It is [a sparsely
inhabited country](Population_of_Canada "wikilink") of
40`{{nbsp}}`{=mediawiki}million people, the vast majority residing south
of the [55th parallel](55th_parallel_north "wikilink") in [urban
areas](List_of_the_largest_population_centres_in_Canada "wikilink").
Canada\'s capital is [Ottawa](Ottawa "wikilink") and [its three largest
metropolitan
areas](List_of_census_metropolitan_areas_and_agglomerations_in_Canada "wikilink")
are [Toronto](Toronto "wikilink"), [Montreal](Montreal "wikilink"), and
[Vancouver](Vancouver "wikilink").

[Indigenous peoples](Indigenous_peoples_in_Canada "wikilink") have
continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years.
Beginning in the 16th century,
[British](British_colonization_of_the_Americas "wikilink") and
[French](French_colonization_of_the_Americas "wikilink") expeditions
explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of
[various armed conflicts](Military_history_of_Canada "wikilink"), France
[ceded nearly all](Treaty_of_Paris_(1763) "wikilink") of [its colonies
in North America](New_France "wikilink") in 1763. In 1867, with the
union of three [British North
American](British_North_America "wikilink") colonies through
[Confederation](Canadian_Confederation "wikilink"), Canada was formed as
a [federal](Federalism "wikilink") [dominion](dominion "wikilink") of
four provinces. This began an [accretion of provinces and
territories](Territorial_evolution_of_Canada "wikilink") and a process
of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom, highlighted by the
*[Statute of Westminster,
1931](Statute_of_Westminster_1931 "wikilink")*, and culminating in the
*[Canada Act 1982](Canada_Act_1982 "wikilink")*, which severed the
vestiges of legal dependence on the [Parliament of the United
Kingdom](Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink").

Canada is a [parliamentary democracy](Parliamentary_system "wikilink")
and a [constitutional monarchy](constitutional_monarchy "wikilink") in
the [Westminster tradition](Westminster_system "wikilink"). The
country\'s [head of government](head_of_government "wikilink") is the
[prime minister](Prime_Minister_of_Canada "wikilink"), who holds office
by virtue of their ability to [command the
confidence](Confidence_and_supply "wikilink") of the elected [House of
Commons](House_of_Commons_of_Canada "wikilink") and is \"called upon\"
by the [governor general](Governor_General_of_Canada "wikilink"),
representing the [monarch of Canada](Monarchy_of_Canada "wikilink"), the
[head of state](head_of_state "wikilink"). The country is a
[Commonwealth realm](Commonwealth_realm "wikilink") and is [officially
bilingual](Official_bilingualism_in_Canada "wikilink") (English and
French) in the federal jurisdiction. It is [very highly
ranked](International_rankings_of_Canada "wikilink") in international
measurements of government transparency, quality of life, economic
competitiveness, innovation, education and gender equality. It is one of
the world\'s most [ethnically
diverse](Ethnic_origins_of_people_in_Canada "wikilink") and
[multicultural](Multiculturalism_in_Canada "wikilink") nations, the
product of [large-scale immigration](Immigration_to_Canada "wikilink").
Canada\'s long and complex [relationship with the United
States](CanadaUnited_States_relations "wikilink") has had a significant
impact on [its history](History_of_Canada "wikilink"),
[economy](Economy_of_Canada "wikilink"), and
[culture](Culture_of_Canada "wikilink").

A [developed country](developed_country "wikilink"), Canada has a [high
nominal per capita income
globally](List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita "wikilink") and
its advanced economy ranks among the [largest in the
world](List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal) "wikilink"), relying chiefly
upon [its abundant natural
resources](Geography_of_Canada#Natural_resources "wikilink") and
well-developed [international trade
networks](List_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_Canada "wikilink").
Canada is recognized as a [middle power](middle_power "wikilink") for
its role in [international
affairs](Foreign_relations_of_Canada "wikilink"), with a tendency to
pursue [multilateral](Multilateralism "wikilink") and
[international](Internationalism_(politics) "wikilink") solutions.
[Canada\'s peacekeeping role](Canadian_peacekeeping "wikilink") during
the 20th century has had a significant influence on its global image.
Canada is part of multiple [international organizations and
forums](International_organisation_membership_of_Canada "wikilink").

## Etymology

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Name of Canada}}
```
While a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological
origins of *Canada*, the name is now accepted as coming from the [St.
Lawrence Iroquoian](St._Lawrence_Iroquoians "wikilink") word
`{{lang|lre|kanata}}`{=mediawiki}, meaning \"village\" or
\"settlement\".[^1] In 1535, Indigenous inhabitants of the present-day
[Quebec City](Quebec_City "wikilink") region used the word to direct
French explorer [Jacques Cartier](Jacques_Cartier "wikilink") to the
village of [Stadacona](Stadacona "wikilink").[^2] Cartier later used the
word *Canada* to refer not only to that particular village but to the
entire area subject to [Donnacona](Donnacona "wikilink") (the chief at
Stadacona);[^3] by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to
this small region along the [Saint Lawrence
River](Saint_Lawrence_River "wikilink") as *Canada*.[^4]

From the 16th to the early 18th century,
\"[Canada](Canada_(New_France) "wikilink")\" referred to the part of
[New France](New_France "wikilink") that lay along the Saint Lawrence
River.[^5] In 1791, the area became two British colonies called [Upper
Canada](Upper_Canada "wikilink") and [Lower
Canada](Lower_Canada "wikilink"). These two colonies were collectively
named [the Canadas](the_Canadas "wikilink") until their union as the
British [Province of Canada](Province_of_Canada "wikilink") in 1841.[^6]

Upon [Confederation in 1867](Canadian_Confederation "wikilink"),
*Canada* was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the
[London Conference](London_Conference_of_1866 "wikilink") and the word
*[dominion](dominion "wikilink")* was conferred as the country\'s
title.[^7] By the 1950s, the term *Dominion of Canada* was no longer
used by the United Kingdom, which considered Canada a \"realm of the
Commonwealth\".[^8]

The *[Canada Act 1982](Canada_Act_1982 "wikilink")*, which brought the
[Constitution of Canada](Constitution_of_Canada "wikilink") fully under
Canadian control, referred only to *Canada*. Later that year, the name
of the national holiday was changed from Dominion Day to [Canada
Day](Canada_Day "wikilink").[^9] The term *Dominion* was used to
distinguish the federal government from the provinces, though after the
[Second World War](Canada_in_World_War_II "wikilink") the term *federal*
had replaced *dominion*.[^10]

### Indigenous peoples {#indigenous_peoples}

The [first inhabitants of North
America](Settlement_of_the_Americas "wikilink") are generally
hypothesized to have migrated from [Siberia](Siberia "wikilink") by way
of the [Bering land bridge](Beringia "wikilink") and arrived at least
14,000 years ago.[^11][^12] The [Paleo-Indian](Paleo-Indian "wikilink")
archeological sites at [Old Crow Flats](Old_Crow_Flats "wikilink") and
[Bluefish Caves](Bluefish_Caves "wikilink") are two of the oldest sites
of human habitation in Canada.[^13] The [characteristics of Indigenous
societies](Technological_and_industrial_history_of_Canada#The_Stone_Age:_Fire_(14,000_BC__AD_1600) "wikilink")
included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal
hierarchies, and trading networks.[^14][^15] Some of these cultures had
collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and
early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological
investigations.[^16] [Indigenous peoples in present-day
Canada](Indigenous_peoples_in_Canada "wikilink") include the [First
Nations](First_Nations_in_Canada "wikilink"), [Inuit](Inuit "wikilink"),
and [Mtis](Mtis_people_in_Canada "wikilink"),[^17] the last being of
[mixed descent](mixed-blood "wikilink") who originated in the mid-17th
century when First Nations people married European settlers and
subsequently developed their own identity.[^18][upright=1.3\|thumb\| A
map of Canada showing the percent of [self-reported indigenous
identity](Population_of_Canada#Indigenous_peoples "wikilink") (First
Nations, Inuit, Mtis) by census division, according to the [2021
Canadian
census](2021_Canadian_census "wikilink")[^19]](File:Indigenous_population_by_census_division.svg "wikilink")

The [Indigenous
population](Population_history_of_indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas "wikilink")
at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been
between 200,000[^20] and two million,[^21] with a figure of 500,000
accepted by Canada\'s [Royal Commission on Aboriginal
Peoples](Royal_Commission_on_Aboriginal_Peoples "wikilink").[^22] As a
consequence of European colonization, the Indigenous population declined
by forty to eighty percent and several First Nations, such as the
[Beothuk](Beothuk "wikilink"), disappeared.[^23] The decline is
attributed to several causes, including the [transfer of European
diseases](Columbian_exchange "wikilink"), such as
[influenza](influenza "wikilink"), [measles](measles "wikilink"), and
[smallpox](smallpox "wikilink"), to which they had no natural
immunity,[^24][^25] conflicts over the fur trade, conflicts with the
colonial authorities and settlers, and the loss of Indigenous lands to
settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations\'
self-sufficiency.[^26][^27]

Although not without conflict, [European
Canadians](European_Canadians "wikilink")\' early interactions with
First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful.[^28] First
Nations and Mtis peoples played a critical part in the development of
[European colonies in
Canada](Former_colonies_and_territories_in_Canada "wikilink"),
particularly for their role in assisting European [coureurs des
bois](coureur_des_bois "wikilink") and [voyageurs](voyageurs "wikilink")
in their explorations of the continent during the [North American fur
trade](North_American_fur_trade "wikilink").[^29] These early European
interactions with First Nations would change from [friendship and peace
treaties](Peace_and_Friendship_Treaties "wikilink") to the dispossession
of Indigenous lands through treaties.[^30][^31] From the late 18th
century, European Canadians forced Indigenous peoples to assimilate into
a western Canadian society.[^32] These attempts reached a climax in the
late 19th and early 20th centuries with [forced integration through
state-funded boarding
schools](Canadian_Indian_residential_school_system "wikilink"),[^33]
[health-care segregation](Indian_hospital "wikilink"),[^34] and
[displacement](High_Arctic_relocation "wikilink").[^35] A period of
redress began with the formation of the [Truth and Reconciliation
Commission of
Canada](Truth_and_Reconciliation_Commission_of_Canada "wikilink") by the
[Government of Canada](Government_of_Canada "wikilink") in 2008.[^36]
This included recognition of past [colonial
injustices](Genocide_of_indigenous_peoples#Canada "wikilink") and
[settlement
agreements](Indian_Residential_Schools_Settlement_Agreement "wikilink")
and betterment of racial discrimination issues, such as addressing the
plight of [missing and murdered Indigenous
women](missing_and_murdered_Indigenous_women "wikilink").[^37][^38]

### European colonization {#european_colonization}

[upright=1.3\|thumb\|Map of territorial claims in [North
America](North_America "wikilink") by 1750. Possessions of [British
America](British_America "wikilink") (pink), [New
France](New_France "wikilink") (blue), and [New
Spain](New_Spain "wikilink") (orange); California, Pacific Northwest,
and Great Basin not
indicated.[^39]](File:Nouvelle-France_map-en.svg "wikilink") It is
believed that the first documented European to explore the east coast of
Canada was [Norse](Vikings "wikilink") explorer [Leif
Erikson](Leif_Erikson "wikilink").[^40][^41] In approximately 1000 AD,
the Norse built a small short-lived encampment that was occupied
sporadically for perhaps 20 years at [L\'Anse aux
Meadows](L'Anse_aux_Meadows "wikilink") on the northern tip of
[Newfoundland](Newfoundland "wikilink").[^42] No further European
exploration occurred until 1497, when seafarer [John
Cabot](John_Cabot "wikilink") explored and claimed Canada\'s [Atlantic
coast](Atlantic_Canada "wikilink") in the name of [Henry VII of
England](Henry_VII_of_England "wikilink").[^43] In 1534, French explorer
Jacques Cartier explored the [Gulf of Saint
Lawrence](Gulf_of_Saint_Lawrence "wikilink") where, on July 24, he
planted a `{{convert|10|m|ft|adj=on}}`{=mediawiki} cross bearing the
words, \"long live the King of France\", and took possession of the
territory New France in the name of [King Francis
I](Francis_I_of_France "wikilink").[^44] The early 16th century saw
European mariners with navigational techniques pioneered by the
[Basque](Basques "wikilink") and
[Portuguese](Portuguese_discoveries "wikilink") establish seasonal
whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast.[^45] In general,
early settlements during the [Age of
Discovery](Age_of_Discovery "wikilink") appear to have been
[short-lived](Population_of_Canada#Ephemeral_European_settlements "wikilink")
due to a combination of the harsh climate, problems with navigating
trade routes and competing outputs in Scandinavia.[^46][^47]

In 1583, Sir [Humphrey Gilbert](Humphrey_Gilbert "wikilink"), by the
[royal prerogative](royal_prerogative "wikilink") of Queen [Elizabeth
I](Elizabeth_I "wikilink"), founded [St John\'s,
Newfoundland](St._John's,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador "wikilink"), as the
first North American [English seasonal
camp](English_overseas_possessions "wikilink").[^48] In 1600, the French
established their first seasonal trading post at
[Tadoussac](Tadoussac "wikilink") along the Saint Lawrence.[^49] French
explorer [Samuel de Champlain](Samuel_de_Champlain "wikilink") arrived
in 1603 and established the first permanent year-round European
settlements at [Port Royal](Port-Royal_(Acadia) "wikilink") (in 1605)
and Quebec City (in 1608).[^50] Among the
[colonists](French_colonization_of_the_Americas "wikilink") of New
France, *[Canadiens](French_Canadians "wikilink")* extensively settled
the Saint Lawrence River valley and [Acadians](Acadians "wikilink")
settled the present-day [Maritimes](The_Maritimes "wikilink"), while fur
traders and [Catholic
missionaries](Catholic_Church_and_the_Age_of_Discovery "wikilink")
explored the [Great Lakes](Great_Lakes "wikilink"), [Hudson
Bay](Hudson_Bay "wikilink"), and the [Mississippi
watershed](Mississippi_watershed "wikilink") to
[Louisiana](Louisiana_(New_France) "wikilink").[^51] The [Beaver
Wars](Beaver_Wars "wikilink") broke out in the mid-17th century over
control of the North American fur trade.[^52]

The English established additional settlements in
[Newfoundland](Newfoundland_(island) "wikilink") in 1610 along with
settlements in the [Thirteen Colonies](Thirteen_Colonies "wikilink") to
the south.[^53][^54] A series of [four
wars](French_and_Indian_Wars "wikilink") erupted in colonial North
America between 1689 and 1763; the later wars of the period constituted
the North American theatre of the [Seven Years\'
War](Seven_Years'_War "wikilink").[^55] Mainland [Nova
Scotia](Nova_Scotia "wikilink") came under British rule with the 1713
[Treaty of Utrecht](Treaty_of_Utrecht "wikilink") and Canada and most of
New France came under British rule in 1763 after the Seven Years\'
War.[^56]

### British North America {#british_north_america}

![[Benjamin West](Benjamin_West "wikilink")\'s *[The Death of General
Wolfe](The_Death_of_General_Wolfe "wikilink")* (1771) dramatizes [James
Wolfe](James_Wolfe "wikilink")\'s death during the [Battle of the Plains
of Abraham](Battle_of_the_Plains_of_Abraham "wikilink") at [Quebec
City](Quebec_City "wikilink").[^57]](Benjamin_West_005.jpg "Benjamin West's The Death of General Wolfe (1771) dramatizes James Wolfe's death during the Battle of the Plains of Abraham at Quebec City.")

The [Royal Proclamation of 1763](Royal_Proclamation_of_1763 "wikilink")
established First Nation treaty rights, created the [Province of
Quebec](Province_of_Quebec_(17631791) "wikilink") out of New France,
and annexed [Cape Breton Island](Cape_Breton_Island "wikilink") to Nova
Scotia.[^59] St John\'s Island (now [Prince Edward
Island](Prince_Edward_Island "wikilink")) became a separate colony in
1769.[^60] To avert conflict in [Quebec](Quebec "wikilink"), the British
Parliament passed the [Quebec Act](Quebec_Act "wikilink") 1774,
expanding Quebec\'s territory to the Great Lakes and [Ohio
Valley](Ohio_River "wikilink").[^61] More importantly, the Quebec Act
afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration at a
time when the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against
British rule.[^62] It re-established the French language, Catholic
faith, and [French civil law](Law_of_France "wikilink") there, staving
off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen
Colonies.[^63] The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered many
residents of the Thirteen Colonies, further fuelling anti-British
sentiment in the years prior to the [American
Revolution](American_Revolution "wikilink").[^64]

After the successful American War of Independence, the [1783 Treaty of
Paris](Treaty_of_Paris_(1783) "wikilink") recognized the independence of
the newly formed [United States](United_States "wikilink") and set the
terms of peace, ceding [British North
American](British_North_America "wikilink") territories south of the
Great Lakes and east of the Mississippi River to the new country.[^65]
The American war of independence also caused a large out-migration of
[Loyalists](Loyalists "wikilink"), the settlers who had fought against
American independence. Many moved to Canada, particularly Atlantic
Canada, where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the
existing territories. [New Brunswick](New_Brunswick "wikilink") was in
turn split from Nova Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist
settlements in the Maritimes, which led to the incorporation of [Saint
John, New Brunswick](Saint_John,_New_Brunswick "wikilink"), as Canada\'s
first city.[^66] To accommodate the influx of English-speaking Loyalists
in Central Canada, the [Constitutional Act of
1791](Constitutional_Act_1791 "wikilink") divided the province of Canada
into French-speaking Lower Canada (later [Quebec](Quebec "wikilink"))
and English-speaking Upper Canada (later
[Ontario](Ontario#Canada_West_(18411867) "wikilink")), granting each
its own elected legislative assembly.[^67] ![[War of
1812](War_of_1812 "wikilink") heroine [Laura
Secord](Laura_Secord "wikilink") warning British commander [James
FitzGibbon](James_FitzGibbon "wikilink") of an [impending American
attack at Beaver
Dams](Battle_of_Beaver_Dams "wikilink")[^68]](Laura_Secord_warns_Fitzgibbons,_1813.jpg "War of 1812 heroine Laura Secord warning British commander James FitzGibbon of an impending American attack at Beaver Dams")

The Canadas were the main front in the [War of
1812](War_of_1812 "wikilink") between the United States and the [United
Kingdom](United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland "wikilink"). Peace
came in 1815; no boundaries were changed.[^70] Immigration resumed at a
higher level, with over 960,000 arrivals from Britain between 1815 and
1850.[^71] New arrivals included refugees escaping the [Great Irish
Famine](Great_Irish_Famine "wikilink") as well as
[Gaelic](Scottish_Gaelic "wikilink")-speaking Scots displaced by the
[Highland Clearances](Highland_Clearances "wikilink").[^72] Infectious
diseases killed between 25 and 33 percent of Europeans who immigrated to
Canada before 1891.[^73]

The desire for [responsible
government](responsible_government "wikilink") resulted in the abortive
[Rebellions of 1837](Rebellions_of_1837 "wikilink").[^74] The [Durham
Report](Durham_Report "wikilink") subsequently recommended responsible
government and the assimilation of French Canadians into English
culture.[^75] The [Act of Union 1840](Act_of_Union_1840 "wikilink")
merged the Canadas into a united Province of Canada and responsible
government was established for all provinces of British North America
east of Lake Superior by 1855.[^76] The signing of the [Oregon
Treaty](Oregon_Treaty "wikilink") by Britain and the United States in
1846 ended the [Oregon boundary
dispute](Oregon_boundary_dispute "wikilink"), extending the border
westward along the [49th parallel](49th_parallel_north "wikilink"). This
paved the way for British colonies on [Vancouver Island
(1849)](Colony_of_Vancouver_Island "wikilink") and in [British Columbia
(1858)](Colony_of_British_Columbia_(18581866) "wikilink").[^77] The
Anglo-Russian [Treaty of Saint Petersburg
(1825)](Treaty_of_Saint_Petersburg_(1825) "wikilink") established the
border along the Pacific coast, but, even after the US [Alaska
Purchase](Alaska_Purchase "wikilink") of 1867, disputes continued about
the exact demarcation of the Alaska--Yukon and Alaska--BC border.[^78]

### Confederation and expansion {#confederation_and_expansion}

[thumb\|upright=1.3\|alt=Refer to caption\|Animated map showing [the
growth and change of Canada\'s provinces and
territories](Territorial_evolution_of_Canada "wikilink") since
Confederation in
1867[^79]](File:Canada_provinces_evolution_2.gif "wikilink")

Following three constitutional conferences, the *[British North America
Act, 1867](Constitution_Act,_1867 "wikilink")* officially proclaimed
Canadian Confederation on July 1, 1867, initially with four provinces:
[Ontario](Ontario "wikilink"), Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New
Brunswick.[^80][^81] Canada assumed control of [Rupert\'s
Land](Rupert's_Land "wikilink") and the [North-Western
Territory](North-Western_Territory "wikilink") to form the [Northwest
Territories](Northwest_Territories "wikilink"), where the Mtis\'
grievances ignited the [Red River
Rebellion](Red_River_Rebellion "wikilink") and the creation of the
province of [Manitoba](Manitoba "wikilink") in July 1870.[^82] British
Columbia and Vancouver Island (which [had been
united](Colony_of_British_Columbia_(18661871) "wikilink") in 1866)
joined the confederation in 1871 on the promise of a transcontinental
railway extending to Victoria in the province within 10 years,[^83]
while Prince Edward Island joined in 1873.[^84] In 1898, during the
[Klondike Gold Rush](Klondike_Gold_Rush "wikilink") in the Northwest
Territories, Parliament created the Yukon Territory.
[Alberta](Alberta "wikilink") and
[Saskatchewan](Saskatchewan "wikilink") became provinces in 1905.[^85]
Between 1871 and 1896, almost one quarter of the Canadian population
emigrated south to the US.[^86]

To open [the West](Western_Canada "wikilink") and encourage European
immigration, the Government of Canada sponsored the construction of
three transcontinental railways (including the [Canadian Pacific
Railway](Canadian_Pacific_Railway "wikilink")), passed the *[Dominion
Lands Act](Dominion_Lands_Act "wikilink")* to regulate settlement and
established the [North-West Mounted
Police](North-West_Mounted_Police "wikilink") to assert authority over
the territory.[^87][^88] This [period of westward
expansion](Post-Confederation_Canada_(18671914)#Expansion "wikilink")
and [nation building](National_Policy "wikilink") resulted in the
displacement of many [Indigenous peoples of the Canadian
Prairies](Plains_Indians "wikilink") to \"[Indian
reserves](Indian_reserve "wikilink")\",[^89] clearing the way for ethnic
European [block settlements](block_settlement "wikilink").[^90] This
caused the collapse of the [Plains Bison in western
Canada](History_of_bison_conservation_in_Canada#Plains_bison "wikilink")
and the introduction of European [cattle farms and wheat
fields](Agriculture_in_Canada "wikilink") dominating the land.[^91] The
Indigenous peoples saw widespread famine and disease due to the loss of
the bison and their traditional hunting lands.[^92] The federal
government did provide emergency relief, on condition of the Indigenous
peoples moving to the reserves.[^93] During this time, Canada introduced
the *[Indian Act](Indian_Act "wikilink")* extending its control over the
First Nations to education, government and legal rights.[^94]

Because Britain still maintained control of Canada\'s foreign affairs
under the British North America Act, 1867, its declaration of war in
1914 automatically brought [Canada into the First World
War](Military_history_of_Canada_during_World_War_I "wikilink").[^95]
Volunteers sent to the [Western
Front](Western_Front_(World_War_I) "wikilink") later became part of the
[Canadian Corps](Canadian_Corps "wikilink"), which played a substantial
role in the [Battle of Vimy Ridge](Battle_of_Vimy_Ridge "wikilink") and
other major engagements of the war.[^96] Out of approximately 625,000
Canadians who served in World War I, some 60,000 were killed and another
172,000 were wounded.[^97] The [Conscription Crisis of
1917](Conscription_Crisis_of_1917 "wikilink") erupted when the
[Unionist](Unionist_Party_(Canada) "wikilink") Cabinet\'s proposal to
augment the military\'s dwindling number of active members with
[conscription](conscription "wikilink") was met with vehement objections
from French-speaking Quebecers.[^98] The *Military Service Act* brought
in compulsory military service, though it, coupled with disputes over
French language schools outside Quebec, deeply alienated Francophone
Canadians and temporarily split the Liberal Party.[^99] In 1919, Canada
joined the [League of Nations](League_of_Nations "wikilink")
independently of Britain,[^100] and the *[Statute of Westminster,
1931](Statute_of_Westminster,_1931 "wikilink")*, affirmed Canada\'s
independence.[^101]

The [Great Depression in Canada](Great_Depression_in_Canada "wikilink")
during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn, leading to hardship
across the country.[^102] In response to the downturn, the [Co-operative
Commonwealth
Federation](Co-operative_Commonwealth_Federation "wikilink") (CCF) in
Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a [welfare
state](welfare_state "wikilink") (as pioneered by [Tommy
Douglas](Tommy_Douglas "wikilink")) in the 1940s and 1950s.[^103] On the
advice of Prime Minister [William Lyon Mackenzie
King](William_Lyon_Mackenzie_King "wikilink"), [war with Germany was
declared](Declaration_of_war_by_Canada#Nazi_Germany "wikilink")
effective September 10, 1939, by King [George VI](George_VI "wikilink"),
seven days after the United Kingdom. The delay underscored Canada\'s
independence.[^104]

The first Canadian Army units arrived in Britain in December 1939. In
all, over a million Canadians served in the armed forces during the
[Second World War](Second_World_War "wikilink") and approximately 42,000
were killed and another 55,000 were wounded.[^105] Canadian troops
played important roles in many key battles of the war, including the
failed 1942 [Dieppe Raid](Dieppe_Raid "wikilink"), the [Allied invasion
of Italy](Allied_invasion_of_Italy "wikilink"), the [Normandy
landings](Normandy_landings "wikilink"), the [Battle of
Normandy](Operation_Overlord "wikilink"), and the [Battle of the
Scheldt](Battle_of_the_Scheldt "wikilink") in 1944.[^106] Canada
provided asylum for the [Dutch monarchy](Dutch_monarchy "wikilink")
while that country was
[occupied](Reichskommissariat_Niederlande "wikilink") and is credited by
the Netherlands for major contributions to [its
liberation](Liberation_Day_(Netherlands) "wikilink") from [Nazi
Germany](Nazi_Germany "wikilink").[^107]

The Canadian economy boomed during the war as its industries
manufactured military [materiel](materiel "wikilink") for Canada,
Britain, [China](Republic_of_China_(19121949) "wikilink"), and the
[Soviet Union](Soviet_Union "wikilink").[^108] Despite another
[Conscription Crisis](Conscription_Crisis_of_1944 "wikilink") in Quebec
in 1944, Canada finished the war with a large army and strong
economy.[^109]

### Contemporary era {#contemporary_era}

The financial crisis of the Great Depression led the [Dominion of
Newfoundland](Dominion_of_Newfoundland "wikilink") to relinquish
responsible government in 1934 and become a [Crown
colony](Crown_colony "wikilink") ruled by a British governor.[^110]
After two [referendums](1948_Newfoundland_referendums "wikilink"),
Newfoundlanders voted to join Canada in 1949 as a province.[^111]

Canada\'s post-war economic growth, combined with the policies of
successive Liberal governments, led to the emergence of a new [Canadian
identity](Canadian_identity "wikilink"), marked by the adoption of the
[maple leaf flag](Flag_of_Canada "wikilink") in 1965,[^112] the
implementation of [official
bilingualism](official_bilingualism "wikilink") (English and French) in
1969,[^113] and the institution of [official
multiculturalism](Multiculturalism#Canada "wikilink") in 1971.[^114]
[Socially democratic](Socially_democratic "wikilink") programs were also
instituted, such as [Medicare](Medicare_(Canada) "wikilink"), the
[Canada Pension Plan](Canada_Pension_Plan "wikilink"), and [Canada
Student Loans](Student_financial_aid_(Canada) "wikilink"); though,
provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, opposed many of
these as incursions into their jurisdictions.[^115] ![A copy of the
*[Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms](Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms "wikilink")*[^116]\|alt=refer
to
caption](Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms_(English).jpg "A copy of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|alt=refer to caption")

Finally, another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the
*Canada Act 1982*, the [patriation](patriation "wikilink") of Canada\'s
constitution from the United Kingdom, concurrent with the creation of
the *[Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms](Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms "wikilink")*.[^118][^119][^120]
Canada had established complete sovereignty as an independent country
under [its own monarchy](Monarchy_of_Canada "wikilink").[^121][^122] In
1999, [Nunavut](Nunavut "wikilink") became Canada\'s third territory
after a series of negotiations with the federal government.[^123]

At the same time, Quebec underwent profound social and economic changes
through the [Quiet Revolution](Quiet_Revolution "wikilink") of the
1960s, giving birth to a secular
[nationalist](Quebec_nationalism "wikilink") movement.[^124] The radical
[Front de libration du
Qubec](Front_de_libration_du_Qubec "wikilink") (FLQ) ignited the
[October Crisis](October_Crisis "wikilink") with a series of bombings
and kidnappings in 1970,[^125] and the
[`{{Not a typo|sovereigntist}}`{=mediawiki}](Quebec_sovereignty_movement "wikilink")
[Parti Qubcois](Parti_Qubcois "wikilink") was elected in 1976,
organizing an [unsuccessful
referendum](1980_Quebec_referendum "wikilink") on
sovereignty-association in 1980. Attempts to accommodate Quebec
nationalism constitutionally through the [Meech Lake
Accord](Meech_Lake_Accord "wikilink") failed in 1990.[^126] This led to
the formation of the [Bloc Qubcois](Bloc_Qubcois "wikilink") in
Quebec and the invigoration of the [Reform Party of
Canada](Reform_Party_of_Canada "wikilink") in the West.[^127][^128] A
[second referendum](1995_Quebec_referendum "wikilink") followed in 1995,
in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4
percent.[^129] In 1997, the [Supreme
Court](Supreme_Court_of_Canada "wikilink") ruled [unilateral
secession](Reference_Re_Secession_of_Quebec "wikilink") by a province
would be unconstitutional, and the [Clarity Act](Clarity_Act "wikilink")
was passed by Parliament, outlining the terms of a negotiated departure
from Confederation.[^130]

In addition to the issues of Quebec sovereignty, a number of crises
shook Canadian society in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These included
the explosion of [Air India Flight 182](Air_India_Flight_182 "wikilink")
in 1985, the largest mass murder in Canadian history;[^131] the [cole
Polytechnique massacre](cole_Polytechnique_massacre "wikilink") in
1989, a [university shooting](School_shooting "wikilink") targeting
female students;[^132] and the [Oka Crisis](Oka_Crisis "wikilink") of
1990,[^133] the first of a number of violent confrontations between
provincial governments and Indigenous groups.[^134] Canada also joined
the [Gulf War](Gulf_War "wikilink") in 1990 as part of a United
States--led coalition force and was active in several peacekeeping
missions in the 1990s, including the [UNPROFOR](UNPROFOR "wikilink")
mission in the [former Yugoslavia](Yugoslav_Wars "wikilink").[^135]
Canada sent [troops to Afghanistan in
2001](Canada_in_the_War_in_Afghanistan "wikilink") but declined to join
the United States--led [invasion of Iraq in
2003](2003_invasion_of_Iraq "wikilink").[^136]

In 2011, Canadian forces participated in the NATO-led intervention into
the [Libyan Civil War](First_Libyan_Civil_War "wikilink")[^137] and also
became involved in battling the [Islamic
State](Islamic_State "wikilink") insurgency in Iraq in the
mid-2010s.[^138] The country celebrated [its
sesquicentennial](150th_anniversary_of_Canada "wikilink") in 2017, three
years before the [COVID-19 pandemic in
Canada](COVID-19_pandemic_in_Canada "wikilink") began on January 27,
2020, with widespread social and economic disruption.[^139] In 2021, the
possible graves of [hundreds of Indigenous people were
discovered](Canadian_Indian_residential_school_gravesites "wikilink")
near the former sites of [Canadian Indian residential
schools](Canadian_Indian_residential_school "wikilink").[^140]
Administered by various Christian churches and funded by the Canadian
government from 1828 to 1997, these [boarding
schools](boarding_school "wikilink") attempted to assimilate Indigenous
children into [Euro-Canadian
culture](European_Canadians#Culture "wikilink").[^141]

[thumb\|right\|upright=1.3\|A topographic map of Canada, in polar
projection (for 90 W), showing elevations shaded from green to brown
(higher)\|alt=refer to caption](File:Canada_topo.jpg "wikilink") By
total area (including its waters), Canada is the [second-largest
country](List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area "wikilink") in the
world, after [Russia](Russia "wikilink").[^142] By land area alone,
Canada [ranks
fourth](List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area "wikilink"), due to
having the world\'s largest area of [fresh water
lakes](List_of_lakes_of_Canada "wikilink").[^143] Stretching from the
[Atlantic Ocean](Atlantic_Ocean "wikilink") in the east, along the
[Arctic Ocean](Arctic_Ocean "wikilink") to the north, and to the
[Pacific Ocean](Pacific_Ocean "wikilink") in the west, the country
encompasses `{{convert|9984670|km2|abbr=on}}`{=mediawiki} of
territory.[^144] Canada also has vast maritime terrain, with the
world\'s longest coastline of
`{{convert|243042|km|mi}}`{=mediawiki}.[^145][^146] In addition to
sharing the [world\'s largest land border with the United

shares a land border with [Greenland](Greenland "wikilink") (and hence
the [Kingdom of Denmark](Kingdom_of_Denmark "wikilink")) to the
northeast, on [Hans Island](Hans_Island "wikilink"),[^147] and a
[maritime boundary](maritime_boundary "wikilink") with
[France](France "wikilink")\'s [overseas
collectivity](overseas_collectivity "wikilink") of [Saint Pierre and
Miquelon](Saint_Pierre_and_Miquelon "wikilink") to the southeast.[^148]
Canada is also home to the world\'s northernmost settlement, [Canadian
Forces Station Alert](CFS_Alert "wikilink"), on the northern tip of
[Ellesmere Island](Ellesmere_Island "wikilink")---latitude
82.5N---which lies `{{convert|817|km|mi}}`{=mediawiki} from the North
Pole.[^149]

Canada can be divided into seven physiographic regions: the [Canadian
Shield](Canadian_Shield "wikilink"), the [interior
plains](interior_plains "wikilink"), the [Great Lakes-St. Lawrence
Lowlands](Great_Lakes-St._Lawrence_Lowlands "wikilink"), the
[Appalachian region](Appalachian_Mountains "wikilink"), the [Western
Cordillera](Pacific_Cordillera_(Canada) "wikilink"), [Hudson Bay
Lowlands](Hudson_Bay_Lowlands "wikilink"), and the [Arctic
Archipelago](Arctic_Archipelago "wikilink").[^150] [Boreal
forests](Taiga "wikilink") prevail throughout the country, ice is
prominent in [northern Arctic regions](Northern_Canada "wikilink") and
through the [Rocky Mountains](Rocky_Mountains "wikilink"), and the
relatively flat [Canadian Prairies](Canadian_Prairies "wikilink") in the
southwest facilitate productive agriculture.[^151] The Great Lakes feed
the [St. Lawrence River](St._Lawrence_River "wikilink") (in the
southeast) where the lowlands host much of Canada\'s economic
output.[^152] Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes---563 of which are larger
than `{{convert|100|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}`{=mediawiki}---containing much
of the world\'s [fresh water](fresh_water "wikilink").[^153][^154] There
are also fresh-water glaciers in the [Canadian
Rockies](Canadian_Rockies "wikilink"), the [Coast
Mountains](Coast_Mountains "wikilink"), and the [Arctic
Cordillera](Arctic_Cordillera "wikilink").[^155] [Canada is geologically
active](Geology_of_Canada "wikilink"), having [many
earthquakes](List_of_earthquakes_in_Canada "wikilink") and [potentially
active volcanoes](Volcanism_of_Canada "wikilink"), notably [Mount Meager
massif](Mount_Meager_massif "wikilink"), [Mount
Garibaldi](Mount_Garibaldi "wikilink"), [Mount
Cayley](Mount_Cayley "wikilink"), and the [Mount Edziza volcanic
complex](Mount_Edziza_volcanic_complex "wikilink").[^156]

### Climate

```{=mediawiki}
{{main|Temperature in Canada}}
```
[upright=1.3\|thumb\|Kppen climate classification types of
Canada](File:Canada_Kppen.svg "wikilink") Average winter and summer
high [temperatures across Canada](Temperature_in_Canada "wikilink") vary
from region to region. Winters can be harsh in many parts of the
country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which
experience a [continental climate](continental_climate "wikilink"),
where daily average temperatures are near
`{{Convert|-15|C|F|lk=on}}`{=mediawiki}, but can drop below
`{{convert|-40|C|F|abbr=on}}`{=mediawiki} with severe [wind
chills](wind_chill "wikilink").[^157] In non-coastal regions, snow can
cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts of
the north snow can persist year-round. Coastal British Columbia has a
temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter. On the east and west
coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s C (70s
F), while between the coasts, the average summer high temperature
ranges from `{{convert|25|to|30|C|F}}`{=mediawiki}, with temperatures in
some interior locations occasionally exceeding
`{{convert|40|C|F|abbr=on}}`{=mediawiki}.[^158]

Much of [Northern Canada](Northern_Canada "wikilink") is covered by ice
and [permafrost](permafrost "wikilink"). The future of the permafrost is
uncertain because the Arctic has been warming at three times the global
average as a result of [climate change in
Canada](climate_change_in_Canada "wikilink").[^159] Canada\'s annual
average temperature over land has risen by
`{{convert|1.7|C-change}}`{=mediawiki}, with changes ranging from
`{{convert|1.1|to|2.3|C-change}}`{=mediawiki} in various regions, since
1948.[^160] The rate of warming has been higher across the North and in
the Prairies.[^161] In the southern regions of Canada, [air pollution
from both Canada](Air_pollution_in_Canada "wikilink") and the United
States---caused by metal smelting, burning coal to power utilities, and
vehicle emissions---has resulted in [acid rain](acid_rain "wikilink"),
which has severely impacted waterways, forest growth, and agricultural
productivity in Canada.[^162]

### Biodiversity

```{=mediawiki}
{{main|Wildlife of Canada}}
```
[thumb\|upright=1.3\| [Terrestrial ecozones and ecoprovinces of
Canada](Ecozones_of_Canada "wikilink"). Ecozones are identified with a
unique colour. Ecoprovinces are subdivisions of ecozones and are
identified with a unique numeric code.[^163]\|alt=Map showing Canada
divided into different
ecozones](File:Terrestrial_ecozones_and_ecoprovinces_of_Canada,_2017.gif "wikilink")

Canada is divided into [15 terrestrial and five marine
ecozones](Ecozones_of_Canada "wikilink").[^164] These ecozones encompass
over 80,000 classified species of [Canadian
wildlife](Wildlife_of_Canada "wikilink"), with an equal number yet to be
formally recognized or discovered.[^165] Although Canada has a low
percentage of [endemic species compared to other
countries](Megadiverse_countries "wikilink"),[^166] due to human
activities, [invasive
species](Wildlife_of_Canada#Invasive_species "wikilink"), and
[environmental issues in the
country](Environmental_issues_in_Canada "wikilink"), there are currently
more than [800 species at risk of being
lost](List_of_Wildlife_Species_at_Risk_(Canada) "wikilink").[^167] About
65 percent of Canada\'s resident species are considered
\"Secure\".[^168] Over half of Canada\'s landscape is intact and
relatively free of human development.[^169] The [boreal forest of
Canada](boreal_forest_of_Canada "wikilink") is considered to be the
largest [intact forest](Intact_forest_landscape "wikilink") on Earth,
with approximately `{{Convert|3000000|km2|abbr=on}}`{=mediawiki}
undisturbed by roads, cities or industry.[^170] Since the end of the
last [glacial period](glacial_period "wikilink"), Canada has consisted
of [eight distinct forest
regions](Forests_of_Canada#Regions "wikilink"),[^171] with 42 percent of
its land area covered by forests (approximately 8 percent of the
world\'s forested land).[^172]

Approximately 12.1 percent of the nation\'s landmass and freshwater are
[conservation areas](National_Wildlife_Area "wikilink"), including 11.4
percent designated as [protected
areas](Protected_areas_of_Canada "wikilink").[^173] Approximately 13.8
percent of its territorial waters are conserved, including 8.9 percent
designated as protected areas.[^174] Canada\'s first [National
Park](National_Parks_of_Canada "wikilink"), [Banff National
Park](Banff_National_Park "wikilink") established in 1885, spans
`{{convert|6,641|km2}}`{=mediawiki}[^175] of mountainous terrain, with
many [glaciers](glacier "wikilink") and [ice
fields](ice_field "wikilink"), dense [coniferous](conifer "wikilink")
forest, and alpine landscapes.[^176] Canada\'s oldest provincial park,
[Algonquin Provincial Park](Algonquin_Provincial_Park "wikilink"),
established in 1893, covers an area of
`{{convert|7653.45|km2}}`{=mediawiki}. It is dominated by [old-growth
forest](old-growth_forest "wikilink") with over 2,400 lakes and 1,200
kilometres of streams and rivers.[^177] [Lake Superior National Marine
Conservation
Area](Lake_Superior_National_Marine_Conservation_Area "wikilink") is the
world\'s largest freshwater protected area, spanning roughly
`{{convert|10000|km2}}`{=mediawiki} of lakebed, its overlaying
freshwater, and associated shoreline on `{{convert|60|km2}}`{=mediawiki}
of islands and mainland.[^178] Canada\'s largest national wildlife
region is the [Scott Islands Marine National Wildlife
Area](Scott_Islands_Marine_National_Wildlife_Area "wikilink"), which
spans `{{convert|11570.65|km2}}`{=mediawiki}[^179] and protects critical
breeding and nesting habitat for over 40 percent of British Columbia\'s
[seabirds](seabirds "wikilink").[^180] Canada\'s 18 [UNESCO Biosphere
Reserves](Biosphere_Reserves_of_Canada "wikilink") cover a total area of
`{{convert|235,000|km2}}`{=mediawiki}.[^181]

surroundings](Parliament_Hill_from_a_Hot_Air_Balloon,_Ottawa,_Ontario,_Canada,_Y2K_(7173715788).jpg "Aerial view of Canadian Parliament Buildings and their surroundings")
Canada is described as a \"[full
democracy](Democracy_Index "wikilink")\",[^182] with a tradition of
[liberalism](liberalism "wikilink"),[^183] and an
[egalitarian](Egalitarianism "wikilink"),[^184]
[moderate](Political_moderate "wikilink") political ideology.[^185] An
emphasis on [social justice](social_justice "wikilink") has been a
distinguishing element of Canada\'s political culture.[^186][^187]
[Peace, order, and good
government](Peace,_order,_and_good_government "wikilink"), alongside an
[Implied Bill of Rights](Implied_Bill_of_Rights "wikilink"), are

At the federal level, Canada has been dominated by two relatively
[centrist](Centrism "wikilink") parties practising \"brokerage
politics\":`{{efn| name=politics|"Brokerage politics: A Canadian term for successful [[Big tent|big tent parties]] that embody a [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralistic]] catch-all approach to appeal to the median Canadian voter ... adopting [[Centrism|centrist policies]] and [[Electoral alliance|electoral coalitions]] to satisfy the short-term preferences of a majority of electors who are not located on the ideological fringe."<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Marland |first1=Alex |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GSeSaYPa2A4C&pg=PA257 |title=Political Marketing in Canada |last2=Giasson |first2=Thierry |last3=Lees-Marshment |first3=Jennifer |publisher=UBC Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-7748-2231-2 |page=257}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Courtney |first1=John |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5KomEXgxvMcC&pg=PA195 |title=The Oxford Handbook of Canadian Politics |last2=Smith |first2=David |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-19-533535-4 |page=195}}</ref> "The traditional ''brokerage'' model of Canadian politics leaves little room for ideology."<ref>{{cite journal|first=Christopher |last=Cochrane |year=2010|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40983510 |title=Left/Right Ideology and Canadian Politics|journal= Canadian Journal of Political Science / Revue Canadienne de Science Politique|volume= 43|issue=3|pages= 583605|doi=10.1017/S0008423910000624 |jstor=40983510 |s2cid=154420921 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Brooks |title=Canadian Democracy: An Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DeQnPIXV5CEC |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-541806-4 |page=265 |quote=Two historically dominant political parties have avoided ideological appeals in favour of a flexible centrist style of politics that is often labelled brokerage politics}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Miriam |last=Smith |title=Group Politics and Social Movements in Canada: Second Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iG4rAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA17 |year=2014 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=978-1-4426-0695-1 |page=17 |quote=Canada's party system has long been described as a "brokerage system" in which the leading parties (Liberal and Conservative) follow strategies that appeal across major [[Cleavage (politics)|social cleavages]] in an effort to defuse potential tensions.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=David |last=Johnson |title=Thinking Government: Public Administration and Politics in Canada, Fourth Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I_HzDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA13 |year=2016 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=978-1-4426-3521-0 |pages=1323 |quote=...most Canadian governments, especially in the federal sphere, have taken a moderate, centrist approach to decision making, seeking to balance growth, stability, and governmental efficiency and economy...}}</ref>}}`{=mediawiki}

Canada](Conservative_Party_of_Canada "wikilink") (or its
[predecessors](Conservative_Party_of_Canada#Predecessors "wikilink")).[^192]
The historically predominant Liberals position themselves at the centre
of the political scale.[^193] Five parties had representatives elected
to the Parliament in the [2021
election](2021_Canadian_federal_election "wikilink")---the Liberals, who
formed a minority government; the Conservatives, who became the
[Official Opposition](Official_Opposition_(Canada) "wikilink"); the New
Democratic Party (occupying the
[left](Left-wing_politics "wikilink")[^194][^195]); the [Bloc
Qubcois](Bloc_Qubcois "wikilink"); and the [Green Party of
Canada](Green_Party_of_Canada "wikilink").[^196]
[Far-right](Far-right "wikilink") and [far-left](far-left "wikilink")
politics have never been a prominent force in Canadian
society.[^197][^198][^199]

Canada has a [parliamentary system](parliamentary_system "wikilink")
within the context of a [constitutional
monarchy](constitutional_monarchy "wikilink")---the [monarchy of
Canada](monarchy_of_Canada "wikilink") being the foundation of the
executive, [legislative](legislative "wikilink"), and
[judicial](judicial "wikilink") branches.[^200][^201][^202][^203] The
[reigning](reign "wikilink") monarch is also monarch of [14 other
Commonwealth countries](Commonwealth_realm "wikilink") (though, all are
sovereign of one another[^204]) and [each of Canada\'s 10
provinces](Monarchy_in_the_Canadian_provinces "wikilink"). To carry out
most of their federal royal duties in Canada, the monarch appoints a
representative, the [governor
general](Governor_General_of_Canada "wikilink"), on the
[advice](Advice_(constitutional_law) "wikilink") of the [prime
minister](Prime_Minister_of_Canada "wikilink").[^205][^206]

The monarchy is the source of
[sovereignty](Canadian_sovereignty "wikilink") and authority in
Canada.[^207][^208][^209] However, while the governor general or monarch
may exercise their power without ministerial
[advice](Advice_(constitutional_law) "wikilink") in certain rare [crisis
situations](Constitutional_crisis "wikilink"),[^210] the use of the
executive powers (or [royal prerogative](royal_prerogative "wikilink"))
is otherwise always directed by the
[Cabinet](Cabinet_of_Canada "wikilink"), a committee of [ministers of
the Crown](Minister_of_the_Crown "wikilink") responsible to the elected
[House of Commons](House_of_Commons_of_Canada "wikilink") and chosen and
headed by the prime minister,[^211] the [head of
government](head_of_government "wikilink"). To ensure the stability of
government, the governor general will usually appoint as prime minister
the individual who is the current leader of the political party that can
obtain the confidence of a [majority](Majority_rule "wikilink") of
members in the House of Commons.[^212] The [Prime Minister\'s
Office](Office_of_the_Prime_Minister_(Canada) "wikilink") (PMO) is thus
one of the most powerful institutions in government, initiating most
legislation for parliamentary approval and selecting for appointment by
the Crown, besides the aforementioned, the governor general, [lieutenant
governors](Lieutenant_Governor_(Canada) "wikilink"), senators, federal
court judges, and heads of [Crown
corporations](Crown_corporations_of_Canada "wikilink") and government
agencies.[^213] The leader of the party with the second-most seats
usually becomes the [leader of the Official
Opposition](Leader_of_the_Official_Opposition_(Canada) "wikilink") and
is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the
government in check.[^214]

![The [House of Commons](House_of_Commons_of_Canada "wikilink") in its
temporary location, the [West
Block](West_Block "wikilink")[^215]\|alt=The House of Commons
chamber](West_Block_Temp_House_of_Commons,_2022.jpg "The House of Commons in its temporary location, the West Block|alt=The House of Commons chamber")
The [Parliament of Canada](Parliament_of_Canada "wikilink") passes all
statute laws within the federal sphere. It comprises the monarch, the
House of Commons, and the [Senate](Senate_of_Canada "wikilink"). While
Canada inherited the British concept of [parliamentary
supremacy](parliamentary_supremacy "wikilink"), this was later, with the
enactment of the Constitution Act, 1982, all but completely superseded
by the American notion of [the supremacy of the
law](Supremacy_Clause "wikilink").[^217]

Each of the 338 [members of
Parliament](Member_of_Parliament_(Canada) "wikilink") in the House of
Commons is elected by simple plurality in an [electoral
district](Electoral_district_(Canada) "wikilink") or riding. The
*[Constitution Act, 1982](Constitution_Act,_1982 "wikilink")*, requires
that no more than five years pass between elections, although the
*[Canada Elections Act](Canada_Elections_Act "wikilink")* limits this to
four years with a \"fixed\" election date in October; [general
elections](Elections_in_Canada "wikilink") still must be called by the
governor general and can be triggered by either the advice of the prime
minister or a lost [confidence vote](confidence_vote "wikilink") in the
House.[^218][^219] The 105 members of the Senate, whose seats are
apportioned on a regional basis, serve until age 75.[^220]

[Canadian federalism](Canadian_federalism "wikilink") divides government
responsibilities between the federal government and the 10 provinces.
[Provincial
legislatures](Legislative_assemblies_of_Canadian_provinces_and_territories "wikilink")
are [unicameral](unicameral "wikilink") and operate in parliamentary
fashion similar to the House of Commons.[^221] Canada\'s three
territories also have legislatures; but, these are not sovereign and
have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces.[^222] The
territorial legislatures also differ structurally from their provincial
counterparts.[^223]

The [Bank of Canada](Bank_of_Canada "wikilink") is the [central
bank](central_bank "wikilink") of the country.[^224] The [minister of
finance](Minister_of_Finance_(Canada) "wikilink") and [minister of
innovation, science, and
industry](Minister_of_Innovation,_Science_and_Industry "wikilink") use
the [Statistics Canada](Statistics_Canada "wikilink") agency for
financial planning and economic policy development.[^225] The Bank of
Canada is the sole authority authorized to issue currency in the form of
[Canadian bank
notes](Banknotes_of_the_Canadian_dollar "wikilink").[^226] The bank does
not issue [Canadian coins](Coins_of_the_Canadian_dollar "wikilink");
they are issued by the [Royal Canadian
Mint](Royal_Canadian_Mint "wikilink").[^227]

### Law

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Law of Canada}}
```
The [Constitution of Canada](Constitution_of_Canada "wikilink") is the
supreme law of the country and consists of written text and unwritten
conventions.[^228] The *Constitution Act, 1867* (known as the [British
North America Act, 1867](British_North_America_Acts "wikilink") prior to
1982), affirmed governance based on parliamentary precedent and divided
powers between the federal and provincial governments.[^229] The
*Statute of Westminster, 1931*, granted full autonomy, and the
*Constitution Act, 1982*, ended all legislative ties to Britain, as well
as adding a constitutional amending formula and the *Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms*.[^230] The *Charter* guarantees basic rights and
freedoms that usually cannot be over-ridden by any government; though, a
[notwithstanding
clause](Section_33_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms "wikilink")
allows Parliament and the provincial legislatures to override certain
sections of the *Charter* for a period of five years.[^231] ![The
[Supreme Court of Canada](Supreme_Court_of_Canada "wikilink") in Ottawa,
west of Parliament
Hill](Supreme_court_of_Canada_in_summer.jpg "The Supreme Court of Canada in Ottawa, west of Parliament Hill")

[Canada\'s judiciary](Court_system_of_Canada "wikilink") plays an
important role in interpreting laws and has the power to strike down
acts of Parliament that violate the constitution. The [Supreme Court of
Canada](Supreme_Court_of_Canada "wikilink") is the highest court, final
arbiter, and has been led since December 18, 2017, by [Richard
Wagner](Richard_Wagner_(judge) "wikilink"), the [Chief Justice of
Canada](Chief_Justice_of_Canada "wikilink").[^232] The governor general
appoints the court\'s nine members on the advice of the prime minister
and [minister of
justice](Minister_of_Justice_and_Attorney_General_of_Canada "wikilink").[^233]
The federal Cabinet also appoints justices to superior courts in the
provincial and territorial jurisdictions.[^234]

[Common law](Common_law "wikilink") prevails everywhere, except in
Quebec, where [civil law](Civil_law_(legal_system) "wikilink")
predominates.[^235] [Criminal law](Criminal_law_of_Canada "wikilink") is
solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout Canada.[^236]
Law enforcement, including criminal courts, is officially a provincial
responsibility, conducted by provincial and municipal police
forces.[^237] In most rural and some urban areas, policing
responsibilities are contracted to the federal [Royal Canadian Mounted
Police](Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police "wikilink").[^238]

[Canadian Aboriginal law](Canadian_Aboriginal_law "wikilink") provides
certain [constitutionally recognized rights to
land](Aboriginal_land_title_in_Canada "wikilink") and traditional
practices for Indigenous groups in Canada.[^239] Various treaties and
case laws were established to mediate relations between Europeans and
many Indigenous peoples.[^240] Most notably, a series of 11 treaties,
known as the [Numbered Treaties](Numbered_Treaties "wikilink"), were
signed between the Indigenous peoples and the reigning monarch of Canada
between 1871 and 1921.[^241] These treaties are agreements between the
Canadian [Crown-in-Council](King-in-Council "wikilink"), with the [duty
to consult and
accommodate](duty_to_consult_and_accommodate "wikilink").[^242] The role
of Aboriginal law and the rights they support were reaffirmed by
[section 35 of the Constitution Act,

Canada is recognized as a [middle power](middle_power "wikilink") for
its role in global affairs with a tendency to pursue
[multilateral](Multilateralism "wikilink") and
[international](Internationalism_(politics) "wikilink")
solutions.[^246][^247][^248] Canada\'s foreign policy based on
international peacekeeping and security is carried out through
coalitions, international organizations, and the work of numerous
federal institutions.[^249][^250] The strategy of the [Canadian
government\'s foreign aid
policy](Foreign_relations_of_Canada#Foreign_aid "wikilink") reflects an
emphasis to meet the [Sustainable Development
Goals](Sustainable_Development_Goals "wikilink"), while also providing
assistance in response to foreign humanitarian crises.[^251] The
[Canadian Security Intelligence
Service](Canadian_Security_Intelligence_Service "wikilink") (CSIS) is
tasked with gathering and analyzing intelligence to prevent threats such
as [terrorism](Terrorism_in_Canada "wikilink"), espionage, and foreign
interference,[^252] while the [Communications Security
Establishment](Communications_Security_Establishment "wikilink") (CSE)
is focused on [cyber security](Cybercrime_in_Canada "wikilink") and
protecting Canada\'s digital infrastructure.[^253]

[Canada and the United
States](CanadaUnited_States_relations "wikilink") have a long, complex,
and intertwined relationship;[^254][^255] they are close allies,
co-operating regularly on military campaigns and humanitarian
efforts.[^256][^257] Canada also maintains historic and traditional
[ties to the United Kingdom](CanadaUnited_Kingdom_relations "wikilink")
and [to France](CanadaFrance_relations "wikilink"),[^258] along with
both countries\' former colonies through its membership in the
[Commonwealth of Nations](Commonwealth_of_Nations "wikilink") and the
`{{Lang|fr|[[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]]}}`{=mediawiki}.[^259]
Canada is noted for having a positive [relationship with the
Netherlands](CanadaNetherlands_relations "wikilink"), owing, in part,
to its contribution to the [Dutch liberation during World War
II](Liberation_of_the_Netherlands "wikilink").[^260] [Canada has
diplomatic and consular
offices](List_of_diplomatic_missions_of_Canada "wikilink") in over 270
locations in approximately 180 foreign countries.[^261]

[Canada\'s peacekeeping role](Canadian_peacekeeping "wikilink") during
the 20th century has played a major role in its positive global
image.[^262][^263] The [Suez Crisis](Suez_Crisis "wikilink") of 1956,
saw future prime minister [Lester B.
Pearson](Lester_B._Pearson "wikilink") eased tensions by proposing the
inception of the [United Nations Peacekeeping
Force](United_Nations_peacekeeping "wikilink"), for which he was awarded
the 1957 [Nobel Peace Prize](Nobel_Peace_Prize "wikilink").[^264]
[Canada has served in over 50 peacekeeping
missions](List_of_Canadian_peacekeeping_missions "wikilink"), including
every UN peacekeeping effort from its inception until 1989.[^265] This
resulted in Canada providing the greatest amount of peacekeepers [during
the Cold War](Canada_in_the_Cold_War "wikilink").[^266] Since 1995,
Canadian direct participation in UN peacekeeping efforts has greatly
declined.[^267] The large decrease was a result of Canada directing its
participation to UN-sanctioned military [operations through
NATO](Canada_in_NATO "wikilink"), rather than directly through the
UN.[^268] Canada has also faced controversy over its involvement in some
foreign countries, notably the 1993 [Somalia
affair](Somalia_affair "wikilink").[^269]

Canada is a [member of various international organizations and
forums](International_organisation_membership_of_Canada "wikilink").[^276]
[Canada was a founding member of the United
Nations](Canada_and_the_United_Nations "wikilink") in 1945 and formed
the [North American Aerospace Defense
Command](North_American_Aerospace_Defense_Command "wikilink") together
with the United States in 1958.[^277] The country has membership in the
[World Trade Organization](World_Trade_Organization "wikilink"), the
[Five Eyes](Five_Eyes "wikilink"), the [G7](G7 "wikilink") and the
[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and

(OECD).[^278] Canada acceded to the [International Covenant on Civil and
Political
Rights](International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights "wikilink")
in 1976.[^279] The country joined the [Organization of American
States](Organization_of_American_States "wikilink") (OAS) in 1990,[^280]
and seeks to expand its ties to [Pacific Rim](Pacific_Rim "wikilink")
economies through membership in the [Asia-Pacific Economic

### Provinces and territories {#provinces_and_territories}

```
[upright=1.3\|thumb\|alt=Labelled map of Canada detailing its provinces
and territories\|Political map of Canada showing its [10 provinces and 3
territories[^282]](Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada "wikilink")\|link=Provinces
and territories of Canada](File:Political_map_of_Canada.svg "wikilink")

Canada is a federation composed of 10 [federated
states](federated_states "wikilink"), called provinces, and three
[federal territories](federal_territories "wikilink"). In turn, these
may be grouped into [four main
regions](List_of_regions_of_Canada "wikilink"): [Western
Canada](Western_Canada "wikilink"), [Central
Canada](Central_Canada "wikilink"), [Atlantic
Canada](Atlantic_Canada "wikilink"), and [Northern
Canada](Northern_Canada "wikilink") (*[Eastern
Canada](Eastern_Canada "wikilink")* refers to Central Canada and
Atlantic Canada together).[^283] Provinces and territories have
responsibility for social programs such as
[healthcare](Healthcare_in_Canada "wikilink"),
[education](Education_in_Canada "wikilink"), and
[welfare](Social_programs_in_Canada "wikilink"),[^284] as well as
administration of justice (but not criminal law). Together, the
provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, a rarity
among other federations in the world. Using its spending powers, the
federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas
such as health and child care; the provinces can opt out of these
cost-share programs but rarely do so in practice. [Equalization
payments](Equalization_payments "wikilink") are made by the federal
government to ensure reasonably uniform standards of services and
taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.[^285]

The major difference between a Canadian province and a territory is that
provinces receive their sovereignty from the Crown[^286] and power and
authority from the *Constitution Act, 1867*, whereas territorial
governments have powers delegated to them by the [Parliament of
Canada](Parliament_of_Canada "wikilink")[^287] and the commissioners
represent the [King in his federal
Council](King-in-Council "wikilink"),[^288] rather than the monarch
directly. The powers flowing from the *Constitution Act, 1867*, are
divided between the federal government and the provincial governments to
exercise exclusively[^289] and any changes to that arrangement require a
[constitutional
amendment](Amendments_to_the_Constitution_of_Canada "wikilink"), while
changes to the roles and powers of the territories may be performed
unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada.[^290]

## Economy

industry.[^291]](Toronto_from_above_at_night.jpg "The Toronto financial district is the second-largest financial centre in North America, the seventh-largest globally in employment and the heart of Canada's finance industry.")

Canada has a [highly developed](Developed_country "wikilink")
[mixed-market economy](Mixed-market "wikilink"),[^293][^294] with the
world\'s [ninth-largest
economy](List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal) "wikilink")
`{{As of|2023|lc=y}}`{=mediawiki}, and a [nominal
GDP](nominal_GDP "wikilink") of approximately
`{{US$|2.221&nbsp;trillion|link=yes}}`{=mediawiki}.[^295] It is one of
the world\'s largest [trading nations](trading_nation "wikilink"), with
a highly [globalized](globalized "wikilink") economy.[^296] In 2021,
Canadian trade in goods and services reached \$2.016 trillion.[^297]
Canada\'s exports totalled over \$637 billion, while its imported goods
were worth over \$631 billion, of which approximately \$391 billion
originated from the United States.[^298] In 2018, Canada had a [trade
deficit](trade_deficit "wikilink") in goods of \$22 billion and a trade
deficit in services of \$25 billion.[^299] The [Toronto Stock
Exchange](Toronto_Stock_Exchange "wikilink") is the ninth-largest stock
exchange in the world by [market
capitalization](market_capitalization "wikilink"), listing over 1,500
companies with a combined market capitalization of over
`{{US$|2&nbsp;trillion}}`{=mediawiki}.[^300]

Canada has a strong [cooperative
banking](cooperative_banking "wikilink") sector, with the world\'s
highest per-capita membership in [credit
unions](credit_union "wikilink").[^301] It ranks low in the [Corruption
Perceptions Index](Corruption_Perceptions_Index "wikilink") (14th in
2023)[^302] and \"is widely regarded as among the least corrupt
countries of the world\".[^303] It ranks high in the [Global
Competitiveness Report](Global_Competitiveness_Report "wikilink") (14th
in 2019)[^304] and [Global Innovation
Index](Global_Innovation_Index "wikilink") (15th in 2023).[^305]
Canada\'s economy ranks above most [Western
nations](Western_nations "wikilink") on [The Heritage
Foundation](The_Heritage_Foundation "wikilink")\'s [Index of Economic
Freedom](Index_of_Economic_Freedom "wikilink")[^306] and experiences a
relatively low level of [income
disparity](Economic_inequality "wikilink").[^307] The country\'s average
household [disposable income](disposable_income "wikilink") per capita
is \"well above\" the OECD average.[^308] Canada ranks among the lowest
of the most developed countries for [housing
affordability](Affordable_housing_in_Canada "wikilink")[^309][^310] and
[foreign direct
investment](foreign_direct_investment "wikilink").[^311][^312]

Since the early 20th century, the growth of [Canada\'s
manufacturing](Manufacturing_in_Canada "wikilink"), mining, and service
sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy to an
urbanized, industrial one.[^313] Like many other developed countries,
the Canadian economy is dominated by the [service
industry](Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy "wikilink"), which employs
about three-quarters of the country\'s workforce.[^314] Among developed
countries, Canada has an unusually important [primary
sector](Primary_sector_of_the_economy "wikilink"), of which the
[forestry](Forestry_in_Canada "wikilink") and [petroleum
industries](Petroleum_industry_in_Canada "wikilink") are the most
prominent components.[^315] Many towns in northern Canada, where
agriculture is difficult, are sustained by nearby mines or sources of
timber.[^316]

Canada\'s economic integration with the United States has increased
significantly since [World War II](World_War_II "wikilink").[^317] The
[Automotive Products Trade
Agreement](Automotive_Products_Trade_Agreement "wikilink") of 1965
opened Canada\'s borders to trade in the automobile manufacturing
industry.[^318] The [Canada&nbsp;-- United States Free Trade
Agreement](Canada&nbsp;_United_States_Free_Trade_Agreement "wikilink")
(FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the
[North American Free Trade
Agreement](North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement "wikilink") (NAFTA)
expanded the free-trade zone to include [Mexico](Mexico "wikilink") in
1994 (later replaced by the [Canada--United States--Mexico
Agreement](United_StatesMexicoCanada_Agreement "wikilink")).[^319] As
of 2023, [Canada is a signatory to 15 free trade
agreements](Free_trade_agreements_of_Canada "wikilink") with 51
different countries.[^320]

Canada is one of the few developed nations that are net exporters of
energy.[^321][^322] [Atlantic Canada possess vast offshore deposits of
natural gas](Offshore_drilling_in_Atlantic_Canada "wikilink"),[^323] and
Alberta hosts the fourth-largest oil reserves in the world.[^324] The
vast [Athabasca oil sands](Athabasca_oil_sands "wikilink") and other oil
reserves give Canada 13 percent of global oil reserves, constituting the
[world\'s third or
fourth-largest](List_of_countries_by_proven_oil_reserves "wikilink").[^325]
Canada is additionally one of the [world\'s largest suppliers of
agricultural products](Agriculture_in_Canada "wikilink"); the Canadian
Prairies region is one of the most important global producers of wheat,
[canola](canola "wikilink"), and other grains.[^326] The [country is a
leading exporter](List_of_exports_of_Canada "wikilink") of zinc,
uranium, gold, nickel, [platinoids](Platinum_group "wikilink"),
aluminum, steel, iron ore, coking coal, lead, copper,
[molybdenum](molybdenum "wikilink"), cobalt, and cadmium.[^327][^328]
Canada has a sizeable manufacturing sector centred in southern Ontario
and Quebec, with automobiles and [aeronautics](aeronautics "wikilink")
representing particularly important industries.[^329] The [fishing
industry](Fishing_industry_in_Canada "wikilink") is also a key
contributor to the economy.[^330]

discovery in genetics, which include [stem cells](stem_cell "wikilink"),
[site-directed mutagenesis](site-directed_mutagenesis "wikilink"),
[T-cell receptor](T-cell_receptor "wikilink"), and the identification of
the genes that cause [Fanconi anemia](Fanconi_anemia "wikilink"),
[cystic fibrosis](cystic_fibrosis "wikilink"), and [early-onset
Alzheimer\'s disease](early-onset_Alzheimer's_disease "wikilink"), among
numerous other diseases.[^347][^348]

The [Canadian Space Agency](Canadian_Space_Agency "wikilink") operates a
highly active space program, conducting deep-space, planetary, and
aviation research and developing rockets and satellites.[^349] Canada
was the third country to design and construct a satellite after the
[Soviet Union](Soviet_space_program "wikilink") and the United States,
with the 1962 [Alouette 1](Alouette_1 "wikilink") launch.[^350] Canada
is a participant in the [International Space

The [2021 Canadian census](2021_Canadian_census "wikilink") enumerated a
[total population](Population_of_Canada_by_year "wikilink") of
36,991,981, an increase of around 5.2 percent over the 2016
figure.[^356] It is estimated that Canada\'s population surpassed
40,000,000 in 2023.[^357] The main drivers of population growth are
[immigration](Immigration_to_Canada "wikilink") and, to a lesser extent,
natural growth.[^358] Canada has one of the highest per-capita
immigration rates in the world,[^359] driven mainly by [economic
policy](Economic_impact_of_immigration_to_Canada "wikilink") and also
[family
reunification](Immigration_categories_(Canada) "wikilink").[^360][^361]
A record 405,000 immigrants were admitted to Canada in 2021.[^362]
Canada leads the world in [refugee
resettlement](Third_country_resettlement "wikilink"); it resettled more
than 28,000 in 2018.[^363] New immigrants settle mostly in [major urban
areas in the
country](List_of_the_largest_population_centres_in_Canada "wikilink"),
such as Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.[^364]

Canada\'s population density, at `{{convert|4.2|PD/km2}}`{=mediawiki},
is among the lowest in the world.[^365] Canada spans latitudinally from
the 83rd parallel north to the 41st parallel north and approximately
95 percent of the population is found south of the 55th parallel
north.[^366] About 80 percent of the population lives within
`{{convert|150|km|mi}}`{=mediawiki} of the border with the contiguous
United States.[^367] Canada is highly urbanized, with over 80 percent of
the population living urban centres.[^368] The most densely populated
part of the country, accounting for nearly 50 percent, is the [Quebec
City--Windsor Corridor](Quebec_CityWindsor_Corridor "wikilink") in
Southern Quebec and Southern Ontario along the Great Lakes and the St.
Lawrence River.[^369][^370]

The majority of Canadians (81.1 percent) live in family households,
12.1 percent report living alone, and those living with other relatives
or unrelated persons reported at 6.8 percent.[^371] Fifty-one percent of
households are couples with or without children, 8.7 percent are
single-parent households, 2.9 percent are multigenerational households,
and 29.3 percent are single-person households.[^372]

### Languages

[upright=1.3\|thumb\|alt=Map of Canada with English speakers and French

A multitude of languages are used by Canadians, with
[English](Canadian_English "wikilink") and
[French](Canadian_French "wikilink") (the [official
languages](official_language "wikilink")) being the [mother
tongues](First_language "wikilink") of approximately 54 percent and
19 percent of Canadians, respectively.[^388] As of the 2021 census, just
over 7.8 million Canadians listed a non-official language as their
[mother tongue](Mother-tongue "wikilink"). Some of the most common
non-official first languages include
[Mandarin](Mandarin_Chinese "wikilink") (679,255 first-language
speakers), [Punjabi](Punjabi_language "wikilink") (666,585),
[Cantonese](Cantonese "wikilink") (553,380), Spanish (538,870),
[Arabic](Arabic "wikilink") (508,410),
[Tagalog](Tagalog_language "wikilink") (461,150), Italian (319,505),
German (272,865), and [Tamil](Tamil_language "wikilink")
(237,890).[^389] [Canada\'s federal government practises official
bilingualism](Official_bilingualism_in_Canada "wikilink"), which is
applied by the [commissioner of official
languages](Office_of_the_Commissioner_of_Official_Languages "wikilink")
in consonance with [section 16 of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms*](section_16_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms "wikilink")
and the federal *[Official Languages
Act](Official_Languages_Act_(Canada) "wikilink")*. English and French
have equal status in federal courts, Parliament, and in all federal
institutions. Citizens have the right, where there is sufficient demand,
to receive federal government services in either English or French and
official-[language minorities](Minority_language "wikilink") are
guaranteed their own schools in all provinces and territories.[^390]

Quebec\'s 1974 *[Official Language
Act](Official_Language_Act_(Quebec) "wikilink")* established French as
the only official language of the province.[^391] Although more than 82
percent of French-speaking Canadians live in Quebec, there are
substantial [Francophone](Francophone "wikilink") populations in [New
Brunswick](Demographics_of_New_Brunswick "wikilink"),
[Alberta](Franco-Albertans "wikilink"), and
[Manitoba](Franco-Manitoban "wikilink");
[Ontario](Franco-Ontarian "wikilink") has the largest French-speaking
population outside Quebec.[^392] New Brunswick, the only officially
bilingual province, has a French-speaking Acadian minority constituting
33 percent of the population.[^393] There are also clusters of Acadians
in southwestern Nova Scotia, on Cape Breton Island, and in central and
western Prince Edward Island.[^394]

Other provinces have no official languages as such, but French is used
as a language of instruction, in courts, and for other government
services, in addition to English. Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec allow
for both English and French to be spoken in the provincial legislatures
and laws are enacted in both languages. In Ontario, French has some
legal status, but is not fully co-official.[^395] There are 11
[Indigenous language groups](Languages_of_Canada "wikilink"), composed
of more than 65 distinct languages and dialects.[^396] Several
Indigenous languages have official status in the Northwest
Territories.[^397] [Inuktitut](Inuktitut "wikilink") is the majority
language in Nunavut and is one of three official languages in the
territory.[^398]

Additionally, Canada is home to many [sign
languages](sign_language "wikilink"), some of which are
Indigenous.[^399] [American Sign
Language](American_Sign_Language "wikilink") (ASL) is used across the
country due to the prevalence of ASL in primary and secondary
schools.[^400] [Quebec Sign Language](Quebec_Sign_Language "wikilink")
(LSQ) is used primarily in Quebec.[^401]

### Religion

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Religion in Canada}}

[Toronto](Toronto "wikilink")[^402]](Freedom_of_Religion_(38007857792).jpg "Freedom of religion sculpture by Marlene Hilton Moore at the McMurtry Gardens of Justice in Toronto")
Canada is religiously diverse, encompassing a wide range of beliefs and
customs.[^404] The [Constitution of
Canada](Constitution_of_Canada "wikilink") refers to God and the
[monarch](Monarchy_of_Canada "wikilink") carries the
[title](Style_and_title_of_the_Canadian_sovereign "wikilink") of
*[Defender of the Faith](Fidei_defensor "wikilink")*; however, Canada
has no official church and the government is officially committed to
[religious pluralism](religious_pluralism "wikilink").[^405] [Freedom of
religion in Canada](Freedom_of_religion_in_Canada "wikilink") is a
constitutionally protected right, allowing individuals to assemble and
worship without limitation or interference.[^406]

Rates of religious adherence have steadily decreased since the
1970s.[^407] With Christianity in decline after having once been central
and integral to Canadian culture and daily life,[^408] Canada has become
a [post-Christian](Postchristianity "wikilink"),
[secular](secular "wikilink") state.[^409][^410][^411] Although the
majority of Canadians consider [religion to be
unimportant](Importance_of_religion_by_country "wikilink") in their
daily lives,[^412] they still believe in God.[^413] The practice of
religion is generally considered a private matter throughout Canadian
society and by the state.[^414]

According to the 2021 census,
[Christianity](Christianity_in_Canada "wikilink") is the largest
religion in Canada, with [Roman Catholics](Roman_Catholic "wikilink")
representing 29.9 percent of the population having the most adherents.
[Christians](Christians "wikilink") overall representing 53.3 percent of
the
population,`{{efn| name=religion|[[Roman Catholicism in Canada|Catholic Church]] (29.9%), [[United Church of Canada|United Church]] (3.3%), [[Anglican Church of Canada|Anglican Church]] (3.1%), [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] (1.7%), [[Baptists in Canada|Baptistism]] (1.2%), [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostalism and other Charismatic]] (1.1%) [[Anabaptism|Anabaptist]] (0.4%), [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness]] (0.4%), [[Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saints]] (0.2%), [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] (0.9%), [[Methodism|Methodist]] and [[Wesleyan Church|Wesleyan]] (Holiness) (0.3%), [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] (0.8%), and [[Reformed Episcopal Church|Reformed]] (0.2%).<ref name="religion2021">{{Cite web |date=October 26, 2022 |title=Religion by visible minority and generation status: Canada, provinces and territories, census metropolitan areas and census agglomerations with parts |url=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=9810034201 |publisher=Statistics Canada}}</ref> 7.6{{nbsp}}percent simply identified as "Christians".<ref name="The Canadian Encyclopedia 2022 z483">{{cite web | title=Christianity | website=The Canadian Encyclopedia | date=October 27, 2022 | url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/christianity | access-date=August 31, 2023}}</ref>}}`{=mediawiki}

population](Sikhism_by_country "wikilink"), behind
[India](Sikhism_in_India "wikilink").[^417]

## Health

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Healthcare in Canada}}
```
Healthcare in Canada is delivered through the provincial and territorial
systems of [publicly funded health
care](publicly_funded_health_care "wikilink"), informally called
[Medicare](Medicare_(Canada) "wikilink").[^418][^419] It is guided by
the provisions of the *[Canada Health
Act](Canada_Health_Act "wikilink")* of 1984[^420] and is
[universal](Universal_health_care "wikilink").[^421] Universal access to
publicly funded health services \"is often considered by Canadians as a
fundamental value that ensures national healthcare insurance for
everyone wherever they live in the country.\"[^422] Around 30 percent of
Canadians\' healthcare is paid for through the private sector.[^423]
This mostly pays for services not covered or partially covered by
Medicare, such as [prescription drugs](prescription_drug "wikilink"),
[dentistry](dentistry "wikilink") and
[optometry](optometry "wikilink").[^424] Approximately 65 to 75 percent
of Canadians have some form of supplementary health insurance; many
receive it through their employers or access secondary social service
programs.[^425][^426]

[thumb\|upright=1.2\|[Health expenditure and financing by
country](List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita "wikilink").
Total health expenditure per capita in US dollars (PPP).\|alt=graph of
expenditures as described in the
caption](File:OECD_health_expenditure_per_capita_by_country.svg "wikilink")

In common with many other developed countries, Canada is experiencing an
increase in healthcare expenditures due to a [demographic
shift](Demographic_transition "wikilink") toward an older population,
with more retirees and fewer people of working age. In 2021, the average
age in Canada was 41.9 years.[^427] Life expectancy is 81.1 years.[^428]
A 2016 report by the [chief public health
officer](Chief_Public_Health_Officer_of_Canada "wikilink") found that
88 percent of Canadians, one of the highest proportions of the
population among G7 countries, indicated that they \"had good or very
good health\".[^429] Eighty percent of Canadian adults self-report
having at least one major risk factor for chronic disease: smoking,
physical inactivity, unhealthy eating or excessive alcohol use.[^430]
Canada has one of the highest rates of adult obesity among
[OECD](OECD "wikilink") countries, contributing to approximately
2.7 million cases of [diabetes](diabetes "wikilink").[^431] Four chronic
diseases---[cancer](cancer "wikilink") (leading cause of death),
[cardiovascular diseases](cardiovascular_diseases "wikilink"),
[respiratory diseases](respiratory_diseases "wikilink"), and
diabetes---account for 65 percent of deaths in Canada.[^432][^433]

In 2021, the [Canadian Institute for Health
Information](Canadian_Institute_for_Health_Information "wikilink")
reported that healthcare spending reached
\$308`{{nbsp}}`{=mediawiki}billion, or 12.7 percent of Canada\'s GDP for
that year.[^434] In 2022, Canada\'s per-capita spending on health
expenditures ranked 12th among [health-care systems in the
OECD](List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita "wikilink").[^435]
Canada has performed close to, or above the average on the majority of
OECD health indicators since the early 2000s, ranking above the average
on OECD indicators for wait-times and access to care, with average
scores for quality of care and use of resources.[^436][^437] The
[Commonwealth Fund\'s](Commonwealth_Fund "wikilink") 2021 report
comparing the healthcare systems of the 11 most [developed
countries](developed_countries "wikilink") ranked Canada
second-to-last.[^438] Identified weaknesses were comparatively higher
infant mortality rate, the prevalence of chronic conditions, long wait
times, poor availability of after-hours care, and a lack of prescription
drugs and dental coverage.[^439] An increasing problem in Canada\'s
health system is a lack of healthcare professionals,[^440] and hospital
capacity.[^441]

## Education

```{=mediawiki}
{{main|Education in Canada|Higher education in Canada}}
```
Education in Canada is for the most part [provided
publicly](State_school "wikilink"), funded and overseen by
[federal](Government_of_Canada "wikilink"),
[provincial](Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada "wikilink"), and [local
governments](local_government "wikilink").[^442] Education is within
provincial jurisdiction and a province\'s curriculum is overseen by its
government.[^443][^444] Education in Canada is generally divided into
[primary education](primary_education "wikilink"), followed by
[secondary](Secondary_education "wikilink") and [post-secondary
education](Tertiary_education "wikilink"). Education in both English and
French is available in most places across Canada.[^445] Canada has a
large number of universities, almost all of which are publicly
funded.[^446] Established in 1663,
`{{Lang|fr|[[Universit Laval]]|italic=no}}`{=mediawiki} is the oldest
post-secondary institution in Canada.[^447] The largest university is
the [University of Toronto](University_of_Toronto "wikilink"), with over
85,000 students.[^448] Four universities are regularly ranked among the
top 100 worldwide, namely University of Toronto, [University of British
Columbia](University_of_British_Columbia "wikilink"), [McGill
University](McGill_University "wikilink"), and [McMaster
University](McMaster_University "wikilink"), with a total of [18
universities ranked](Rankings_of_universities_in_Canada "wikilink") in
the top 500 worldwide.[^449] [thumb\|upright=1.3\| Canada by province
and territory, showing the percentage of the population aged 25 to 64
who had a bachelor\'s degree or higher, and the percentage point change
from 2016 to 2021.[^450]](File:Educationincanada-eng.png "wikilink")

According to a 2022 report by the OECD, Canada is one of the most
educated countries in the world;[^451][^452] the country ranks first
worldwide in the percentage of adults having tertiary education, with
over 56 percent of Canadian adults having attained at least an
undergraduate college or university degree.[^453] Canada spends an
average of 5.3 percent of its GDP on education.[^454] The country
invests heavily in tertiary education (more than
`{{US$|20,000}}`{=mediawiki} per student).[^455]
`{{As of|2022}}`{=mediawiki}, 89 percent of adults aged 25 to 64 have
earned the equivalent of a high-school degree, compared to an OECD
average of 75 percent.[^456]

The [mandatory education](Compulsory_education "wikilink") age ranges
between 5--7 to 16--18 years,[^457] contributing to an adult literacy
rate of 99 percent.[^458] Just over 60,000 children are [homeschooled in
the country](Homeschooling_in_Canada "wikilink") as of 2016. The
[Programme for International Student
Assessment](Programme_for_International_Student_Assessment "wikilink")
indicates Canadian students perform well above the OECD average,
particularly in mathematics, science, and reading,[^459][^460] ranking
the overall knowledge and skills of Canadian 15-year-olds as the
sixth-best in the world, although these scores have been declining in
recent years. Canada is a well-performing OECD country in reading
literacy, mathematics, and science, with the average student scoring
523.7, compared with the OECD average of 493 in 2015.[^461][^462]

## Culture

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Culture of Canada}}
```
![*[Monument to
Multiculturalism](Monument_to_Multiculturalism "wikilink")* by Francesco
Pirelli, in
Toronto[^463]](Statue_outside_Union_Station.jpg "Monument to Multiculturalism by Francesco Pirelli, in Toronto")

Canada\'s culture draws influences from its broad range of constituent
nationalities and policies that promote a \"[just
society](just_society "wikilink")\" are constitutionally
protected.[^465][^466][^467] Since the 1960s, Canada has emphasized
equality and inclusiveness for all its people.[^468][^469][^470] [The
official state policy of
multiculturalism](Multiculturalism_in_Canada "wikilink") is often cited
as one of Canada\'s significant accomplishments[^471] and a key
distinguishing element of Canadian identity.[^472][^473] In Quebec,
cultural identity is strong and there is a [French Canadian
culture](Culture_of_Quebec "wikilink") that is distinct from English
Canadian culture.[^474] As a whole, Canada is in theory a [cultural
mosaic](cultural_mosaic "wikilink") of regional ethnic
subcultures.[^475][^476][^477]

Canada\'s approach to governance emphasizing multiculturalism, which is
based on selective [immigration](Economic_migrant "wikilink"), [social
integration](social_integration "wikilink"), and
[suppression](Dissent "wikilink") of far-right politics, has wide public
support.[^478] Government policies such as publicly funded health care,
[higher taxation](Income_taxes_in_Canada "wikilink") to redistribute
wealth, the [outlawing of capital
punishment](Capital_punishment_in_Canada "wikilink"), strong efforts to
[eliminate poverty](Poverty_in_Canada "wikilink"), [strict gun
control](Gun_politics_in_Canada "wikilink"), a [social
liberal](social_liberal "wikilink") attitude toward [women\'s
rights](Feminism_in_Canada "wikilink") (like [pregnancy
termination](Abortion_in_Canada "wikilink")) and [LGBT
rights](LGBT_rights_in_Canada "wikilink"), and legalized
[euthanasia](Euthanasia_in_Canada "wikilink") and [cannabis
use](Cannabis_in_Canada "wikilink") are indicators of Canada\'s
political and [cultural
values](Canadian_values "wikilink").[^479][^480][^481] Canadians also
identify with the country\'s foreign aid policies, peacekeeping roles,
the [national park system](National_Parks_of_Canada "wikilink"), and the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.[^482][^483]

Historically, Canada has been influenced by
[British](Culture_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink"),
[French](French_culture "wikilink"), and Indigenous cultures and
traditions. Through their language,
[art](Native_American_art "wikilink"), and
[music](First_Nations_music "wikilink"), Indigenous peoples continue to
influence the Canadian identity.[^484] During the 20th century,
Canadians with African, Caribbean, and Asian nationalities have added to
the Canadian identity and its culture.[^485]

### Symbols

```{=mediawiki}

```
[upright=0.9\|thumb\|alt=*The mother beaver* sculpture outside the House
of Commons\|*The mother beaver* on the Canadian parliament\'s [Peace

each represent an ethnicity---[Tudor rose](Tudor_rose "wikilink"):

[leek](leek "wikilink"):
[Welsh](Welsh_people "wikilink").](File:Beaver_sculpture,_Centre_Block.jpg "wikilink")

Themes of nature, pioneers, trappers, and traders played an important
part in the early development of Canadian symbolism.[^487] Modern
symbols emphasize the country\'s geography, cold climate, lifestyles,
and the Canadianization of traditional European and Indigenous
symbols.[^488] The use of the [maple leaf](maple_leaf "wikilink") as a
Canadian symbol dates to the early 18th century. The maple leaf is
depicted on Canada\'s [current](Flag_of_Canada "wikilink") and [previous
flags](Canadian_Red_Ensign "wikilink") and on the [Arms of
Canada](Arms_of_Canada "wikilink").[^489] Canada\'s official tartan,
known as the \"[maple leaf
tartan](Regional_tartans_of_Canada "wikilink")\", has four colours that
reflect the colours of the maple leaf as it changes through the
seasons---green in the [spring](Spring_(season) "wikilink"), gold in the
early [autumn](autumn "wikilink"), red at the first
[frost](frost "wikilink"), and brown after falling.[^490] The Arms of
Canada are closely modelled after [those of the United
Kingdom](Royal_coat_of_arms_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink"), with
French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those
derived from the British version.[^491]

Other prominent symbols include the national motto,
\"`{{lang|la|[[A mari usque ad mare]]|italics=on}}`{=mediawiki}\"
(\"From Sea to Sea\"),[^492] the sports of [ice
hockey](ice_hockey "wikilink") and [lacrosse](lacrosse "wikilink"), the
[beaver](beaver "wikilink"), [Canada goose](Canada_goose "wikilink"),
[common loon](common_loon "wikilink"), [Canadian
horse](Canadian_horse "wikilink"), the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,
the Canadian Rockies,[^493] and, more recently, the [totem
pole](totem_pole "wikilink") and [Inuksuk](Inuksuk "wikilink").[^494]
[Canadian beer](Canadian_beer "wikilink"), [maple
syrup](maple_syrup "wikilink"), [tuques](tuque "wikilink"),
[canoes](canoes "wikilink"), [nanaimo bars](nanaimo_bar "wikilink"),
[butter tarts](butter_tart "wikilink"), and
[poutine](poutine "wikilink") are defined as uniquely
Canadian.[^495][^496] Canadian coins feature many of these symbols: the
loon on the [\$1 coin](Loonie "wikilink"), the Arms of Canada on the
[50 piece](50-cent_piece_(Canadian_coin) "wikilink"), and the beaver on
the [nickel](Nickel_(Canadian_coin) "wikilink").[^497] An image of the
previous monarch, Queen [Elizabeth II](Elizabeth_II "wikilink"), appears
on [\$20 bank notes](Canadian_dollar "wikilink") and the obverse of all
current Canadian coins.[^498]

### Literature

```{=mediawiki}
{{main|Canadian literature}}
```
Canadian literature is often divided into French- and English-language
literatures, which are rooted in the literary traditions of France and
Britain, respectively.[^499] The earliest Canadian narratives were of
travel and exploration.[^500] This progressed into three major themes
that can be found within historical Canadian literature: nature,
frontier life, and Canada\'s position within the world, all three of
which tie into the [garrison
mentality](garrison_mentality "wikilink").[^501] In recent decades,
Canada\'s literature has been strongly influenced by immigrants from
around the world.[^502] By the 1990s, Canadian literature was viewed as
some of the world\'s best.[^503]

Numerous [Canadian authors](List_of_Canadian_writers "wikilink") have
accumulated international literary awards,[^504] including novelist,
poet, and literary critic [Margaret Atwood](Margaret_Atwood "wikilink"),
who received two [Booker Prizes](Booker_Prize "wikilink");[^505] [Nobel
laureate](Nobel_Prize_in_Literature "wikilink") [Alice
Munro](Alice_Munro "wikilink"), who has been called the best living
writer of short stories in English;[^506] and Booker Prize recipient
[Michael Ondaatje](Michael_Ondaatje "wikilink"), who wrote the novel
*[The English Patient](The_English_Patient "wikilink")*, which was
adapted as a [film of the same
name](The_English_Patient_(film) "wikilink") that won the [Academy Award
for Best Picture](Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture "wikilink").[^507] [L.
M. Montgomery](L._M._Montgomery "wikilink") produced a series of
children\'s novels beginning in 1908 with *[Anne of Green
Gables](Anne_of_Green_Gables "wikilink")*.[^508]

### Media

```{=mediawiki}
{{main|Media of Canada}}
```
![A [Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation](Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation "wikilink") (CBC)
satellite truck, used for live television
broadcasts](CBC_Radio_Canada_Chevrolet_Express_02.jpg "A Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) satellite truck, used for live television broadcasts")
Canada\'s media is [highly autonomous](Press_Freedom_Index "wikilink"),
[uncensored](Censorship_by_country "wikilink"),
[diverse](Multicultural_media_in_Canada "wikilink"), and very
regionalized.[^509][^510] The *[Broadcasting
Act](Broadcasting_Act_(1991) "wikilink")* declares \"the system should
serve to safeguard, enrich, and strengthen the cultural, political,
social, and economic fabric of Canada\".[^511] Canada has a
well-developed media sector, but its cultural output---particularly in
[English films](Cinema_of_Canada "wikilink"), [television
shows](Television_in_Canada "wikilink"), and
[magazines](List_of_Canadian_magazines "wikilink")---is often
overshadowed by imports from the United States.[^512] As a result, the
preservation of a distinctly Canadian culture is supported by federal
government programs, laws, and institutions such as the [Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation](Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation "wikilink")
(CBC), the [National Film Board of
Canada](National_Film_Board_of_Canada "wikilink") (NFB), and the
[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications
Commission](Canadian_Radio-television_and_Telecommunications_Commission "wikilink")
(CRTC).[^513]

[Canadian mass media](Mass_media_in_Canada "wikilink"), both
[print](Newspapers_of_Canada "wikilink") and
[digital](Canadian_online_media "wikilink"), and in both official
languages, is largely dominated by a \"[handful of
corporations](Media_ownership_in_Canada "wikilink")\".[^514] The largest
of these corporations is the country\'s national [public
broadcaster](public_broadcaster "wikilink"), the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation, which also plays a significant role in producing domestic
cultural content, operating [its own radio](CBC_Radio "wikilink") and
[TV](CBC_Television "wikilink") networks in both English and
French.[^515] In addition to the CBC, some provincial governments offer
their own public educational TV broadcast services as well, such as
[TVOntario](TVOntario "wikilink") and
[Tl-Qubec](Tl-Qubec "wikilink").[^516]

Non-news media content in Canada, including film and television, is
influenced both by local creators as well as by imports from the United
States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and France.[^517] In an effort to
reduce the amount of foreign-made media, government interventions in
television broadcasting can include both regulation of content and
public financing.[^518] [Canadian tax
laws](Taxation_in_Canada "wikilink") limit foreign competition in
magazine advertising.[^519]

### Visual arts {#visual_arts}

```{=mediawiki}
{{main|Canadian art}}
```
[thumb\|upright=0.9\|alt=Oil on canvas painting of a tree dominating its
rocky landscape during a sunset\|*[The Jack
Pine](The_Jack_Pine "wikilink")* by [Tom
Thomson](Tom_Thomson "wikilink"). Oil on canvas, 1916, in the collection
of the [National Gallery of
Canada](National_Gallery_of_Canada "wikilink").[^520]](File:The_Jack_Pine,_by_Tom_Thomson.jpg "wikilink")

Art in Canada is marked by thousands of years of habitation by its
Indigenous peoples,[^521] and, in later times, artists have combined
British, French, Indigenous, and American artistic traditions, at times
embracing European styles while working to promote nationalism.[^522]
The nature of Canadian art reflects these diverse origins, as artists
have taken their traditions and adapted these influences to reflect the
reality of their lives in Canada.[^523]

The Canadian government has played a role in the development of Canadian
culture through the department of [Canadian
Heritage](Canadian_Heritage "wikilink"), by giving grants to art
galleries,[^524] as well as establishing and funding art schools and
colleges across the country, and through the [Canada Council for the
Arts](Canada_Council_for_the_Arts "wikilink"), the national public arts
funder, helping artists, art galleries and periodicals, and thus
contributing to the development of Canada\'s cultural works.[^525]

Canadian visual art has been dominated by figures, such as painter [Tom
Thomson](Tom_Thomson "wikilink") and the [Group of
Seven](Group_of_Seven_(artists) "wikilink").[^526] The latter were
painters with a nationalistic and idealistic focus, who first exhibited
their distinctive works in May 1920. Though referred to as having seven
members, five artists---[Lawren Harris](Lawren_Harris "wikilink"), [A.
Y. Jackson](A._Y._Jackson "wikilink"), [Arthur
Lismer](Arthur_Lismer "wikilink"), [J. E. H.
MacDonald](J._E._H._MacDonald "wikilink"), and [Frederick
Varley](Frederick_Varley "wikilink")---were responsible for articulating
the group\'s ideas. They were joined briefly by [Frank
Johnston](Frank_Johnston_(artist) "wikilink") and commercial artist
[Franklin Carmichael](Franklin_Carmichael "wikilink"). [A. J.
Casson](A._J._Casson "wikilink") became part of the group in 1926.[^527]
Associated with the group was another prominent Canadian artist, [Emily
Carr](Emily_Carr "wikilink"), known for her landscapes and portrayals of
the [Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest
Coast](Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Pacific_Northwest_Coast "wikilink").[^528]

### Music

![Original publication of \"[O Canada](O_Canada "wikilink")\" in
English,
1908[^529]](O-Canada-1908.pdf "Original publication of "O Canada" in English, 1908")
Canadian music reflects a [variety of regional
scenes](Music_of_Canadian_cultures "wikilink").[^531] Canada has
developed a vast music infrastructure that includes [church
halls](church_hall "wikilink"), [chamber
halls](Chamber_music "wikilink"),
[conservatories](Music_school "wikilink"),
[academies](academies "wikilink"), [performing arts
centres](performing_arts_center "wikilink"), [record
companies](record_company "wikilink"), [radio
stations](radio_stations "wikilink"), and television [music
video](music_video "wikilink") channels.[^532] Government support
programs, such as the Canada Music Fund, assist a wide range of
musicians and entrepreneurs who create, produce and market original and
diverse Canadian music.[^533] As a result of its cultural importance, as
well as government initiatives and regulations, the Canadian music
industry is one of the largest in the world,[^534] producing
internationally renowned
[composers](List_of_Canadian_composers "wikilink"),
[musicians](List_of_Canadian_musicians "wikilink"), and
[ensembles](List_of_bands_from_Canada "wikilink").[^535] Music
broadcasting in the country is regulated by the CRTC.[^536] The
[Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and
Sciences](Canadian_Academy_of_Recording_Arts_and_Sciences "wikilink")
presents Canada\'s music industry awards, the [Juno
Awards](Juno_Award "wikilink").[^537] The [Canadian Music Hall of
Fame](Canadian_Music_Hall_of_Fame "wikilink") honours Canadian musicians
for their lifetime achievements.[^538]

[Patriotic music in
Canada](Anthems_and_nationalistic_songs_of_Canada "wikilink") dates back
over 200 years. The earliest work of patriotic music in Canada, \"[The
Bold Canadian](The_Bold_Canadian "wikilink")\", was written in
1812.[^539] \"[The Maple Leaf
Forever](The_Maple_Leaf_Forever "wikilink")\", written in 1866, was a
popular patriotic song throughout [English
Canada](English_Canada "wikilink") and, for many years, served as an
unofficial national anthem.[^540] \"[O Canada](O_Canada "wikilink")\"
also served as an unofficial national anthem for much of the 20th
century and was adopted as the country\'s official anthem in 1980.[^541]
[Calixa Lavalle](Calixa_Lavalle "wikilink") wrote the music, which was
a setting of a patriotic poem composed by the poet and judge Sir
[Adolphe-Basile Routhier](Adolphe-Basile_Routhier "wikilink"). The text
was originally only in French before it was adapted into English in
1906.[^542]

### Sports

![The [Canadian men\'s national ice hockey
team](Canadian_men's_national_ice_hockey_team "wikilink") celebrates
shortly after winning the gold medal final at the [2010 Winter
Olympics](2010_Winter_Olympics "wikilink").[^543]](Canada2010WinterOlympicsOTcelebration.jpg "The Canadian men's national ice hockey team celebrates shortly after winning the gold medal final at the 2010 Winter Olympics.")

The [roots of organized sports in
Canada](History_of_Canadian_sports "wikilink") date back to the
1770s,[^545] culminating in the development and popularization of the
major professional games of [ice
hockey](Ice_hockey_in_Canada "wikilink"),
[lacrosse](Lacrosse_in_Canada "wikilink"),
[curling](curling "wikilink"),
[basketball](Basketball_in_Canada "wikilink"),
[baseball](Baseball_in_Canada "wikilink"),
[soccer](Soccer_in_Canada "wikilink"), and [Canadian
football](Canadian_football "wikilink").[^546] Canada\'s official
national sports are ice hockey and lacrosse.[^547] Other sports such as
[golf](golf "wikilink"), [volleyball](Volleyball_in_Canada "wikilink"),
[skiing](skiing "wikilink"), [cycling](cycling_in_Canada "wikilink"),
[swimming](swimming_(sport) "wikilink"),
[badminton](badminton "wikilink"), [tennis](tennis "wikilink"),
[bowling](bowling "wikilink"), and the study of [martial
arts](martial_arts "wikilink") are all widely enjoyed at the youth and
amateur levels.[^548] Great achievements in Canadian sports are
recognized by [Canada\'s Sports Hall of
Fame](Canada's_Sports_Hall_of_Fame "wikilink").[^549] There are numerous
other sport \"halls of fame\" in Canada, such as the [Hockey Hall of
Fame](Hockey_Hall_of_Fame "wikilink").[^550]

Canada shares several [major professional sports
leagues](Major_professional_sports_leagues_in_the_United_States_and_Canada "wikilink")
with the United States.[^551] Canadian teams in these leagues include
seven franchises in the [National Hockey
League](National_Hockey_League "wikilink"), as well as three [Major
League Soccer](Soccer_in_Canada#Major_League_Soccer "wikilink") teams
and one team in each of [Major League
Baseball](Major_League_Baseball "wikilink") and the [National Basketball
Association](National_Basketball_Association "wikilink"). Other popular
professional competitions include the [Canadian Football
League](Canadian_Football_League "wikilink"), [National Lacrosse
League](National_Lacrosse_League "wikilink"), the [Canadian Premier
League](Canadian_Premier_League "wikilink"), and the various curling
tournaments sanctioned and organized by [Curling
Canada](Curling_Canada "wikilink").[^552]

Canada has enjoyed success both [at the Winter
Olympics](Canada_at_the_Winter_Olympics "wikilink") and [at the Summer
Olympics](Canada_at_the_Summer_Olympics "wikilink")[^553]---though,
particularly, the Winter Games as a \"winter sports nation\"---and has
hosted several high-profile international sporting events such as the
[1976 Summer Olympics](1976_Summer_Olympics "wikilink"),[^554] the [1988
Winter Olympics](1988_Winter_Olympics "wikilink"),[^555] the [2010
Winter Olympics](2010_Winter_Olympics "wikilink"),[^556][^557] and the
[2015 FIFA Women\'s World
Cup](2015_FIFA_Women's_World_Cup "wikilink").[^558] Most recently,
Canada hosted the [2015 Pan American
Games](2015_Pan_American_Games "wikilink") and [2015 Parapan American
Games](2015_Parapan_American_Games "wikilink") in Toronto.[^559] The
country is scheduled to co-host the [2026 FIFA World
Cup](2026_World_Cup "wikilink") alongside Mexico and the United
States.[^560]

The **United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland**, commonly

**Britain**,`{{Efn|Usage is mixed. The ''[https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-u Guardian]'' and ''[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/style-book/places-and-people Telegraph]'' use Britain as a synonym for the United Kingdom. Some prefer to use Britain as shorthand for [[Great Britain]]. The British [[Cabinet Office]]'s [[Government Digital Service]] [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style#great-britain style guide] for use on [[gov.uk]] recommends: "Use UK and United Kingdom in preference to Britain and British (UK business, UK foreign policy, ambassador and high commissioner). But British embassy, not UK embassy."}}`{=mediawiki}
is a [country](country "wikilink") in [Northwestern
Europe](Northwestern_Europe "wikilink"), off the north-western coast of
the [continental mainland](European_mainland "wikilink").[^1][^2] It
comprises [England](England "wikilink"),
[Scotland](Scotland "wikilink"), [Wales](Wales "wikilink"), and
[Northern Ireland](Northern_Ireland "wikilink").[^3] It includes the
island of [Great Britain](Great_Britain "wikilink"), the north-eastern
part of the island of [Ireland](Ireland "wikilink"), and most of the
[smaller islands](List_of_islands_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink")
within the [British Isles](British_Isles "wikilink").[^4] Northern
Ireland shares [a land
border](Republic_of_IrelandUnited_Kingdom_border "wikilink") with the
[Republic of Ireland](Republic_of_Ireland "wikilink"); otherwise, the
United Kingdom is surrounded by the [Atlantic
Ocean](Atlantic_Ocean "wikilink"), the [North
Sea](North_Sea "wikilink"), the [English
Channel](English_Channel "wikilink"), the [Celtic
Sea](Celtic_Sea "wikilink"), and the [Irish Sea](Irish_Sea "wikilink").
The total area of the United Kingdom is
`{{Convert|244376|km2|sqmi|order=flip}}`{=mediawiki},`{{efn|name=ONSArea}}`{=mediawiki}[^5]
with an estimated population of just over 67 million people in 2021.[^6]

The United Kingdom has evolved from a series of annexations, unions and
separations of constituent countries over several hundred years. The
[Treaty of Union](Treaty_of_Union "wikilink") between the [Kingdom of
England](Kingdom_of_England "wikilink") (which included
[Wales](Wales "wikilink")) and the [Kingdom of
Scotland](Kingdom_of_Scotland "wikilink") in 1707 resulted in their
unification to become the [Kingdom of Great
Britain](Kingdom_of_Great_Britain "wikilink"). Its [union in
1801](Acts_of_Union_1800 "wikilink") with the [Kingdom of
Ireland](Kingdom_of_Ireland "wikilink") created the [United Kingdom of
Great Britain and
Ireland](United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland "wikilink"). Most
of Ireland seceded from the UK in 1922, leaving the present United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which formally adopted
its name in
1927.`{{Efn|The 1921 [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] resolved the [[Irish War of Independence]]. When it took effect one year later, it established the [[Irish Free State]] as a separate [[dominion]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. In 1927 the [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927]] changed the name of the UK to reflect this.}}`{=mediawiki}
The nearby [Isle of Man](Isle_of_Man "wikilink"),
[Guernsey](Bailiwick_of_Guernsey "wikilink") and
[Jersey](Jersey "wikilink") are not part of the UK, being [Crown
Dependencies](Crown_Dependencies "wikilink"), but the [British
government](British_government "wikilink") is responsible for their
defence and international representation.[^7]

The UK became the first [industrialised](Industrialisation "wikilink")
country and was the world\'s [foremost power](foremost_power "wikilink")
for the majority of the 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly
during the \"[Pax Britannica](Pax_Britannica "wikilink")\" between 1815
and 1914.[^8][^9] The [British Empire](British_Empire "wikilink"), at
its height in the 1920s, encompassed almost a quarter of the world\'s
landmass and population, and was the [largest empire in
history](List_of_largest_empires#Empires_at_their_greatest_extent "wikilink");
however, its involvement in the [First World
War](First_World_War "wikilink") and the [Second World
War](Second_World_War "wikilink") damaged Britain\'s economic power and
a global wave of [decolonisation](decolonisation "wikilink") led to the
independence of most British colonies.[^10][^11][^12] British influence
can be observed in the legal and political systems of many of [its
former
colonies](List_of_countries_that_have_gained_independence_from_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink"),
and the [UK\'s culture](Culture_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink")
remains globally influential, particularly [in
language](English-speaking_world "wikilink"),
[literature](British_literature "wikilink"),
[music](Music_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") and
[sport](Sport_in_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink").
[English](English_language "wikilink") is the world\'s [most widely
spoken
language](List_of_languages_by_total_number_of_speakers "wikilink") and
the [third-most spoken native
language](list_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers "wikilink").[^13]

The United Kingdom is a [constitutional
monarchy](constitutional_monarchy "wikilink") and [parliamentary
democracy](parliamentary_democracy "wikilink").`{{Efn|The United Kingdom does not have a codified constitution but an unwritten one formed of Acts of Parliament, court judgments, traditions, and conventions.<ref>{{Citation |title=What is the UK Constitution? |date=9 August 2018 |url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/what-uk-constitution/what-uk-constitution |publisher=The Constitution Unit of UCL |access-date=6 February 2020}}</ref>}}`{=mediawiki}[^14]
The capital and [largest
city](List_of_urban_areas_in_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") of the
United Kingdom (as well as the capital of England) is
[London](London "wikilink"). The cities of
[Edinburgh](Edinburgh "wikilink"), [Cardiff](Cardiff "wikilink"), and
[Belfast](Belfast "wikilink") are respectively the national capitals of
Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Other major cities include
[Birmingham](Birmingham "wikilink"),
[Manchester](Manchester "wikilink"), [Glasgow](Glasgow "wikilink"), and
[Leeds](Leeds "wikilink").[^15] The UK consists of three distinct legal
jurisdictions: [England and Wales](English_Law "wikilink"),
[Scotland](Scots_Law "wikilink"), and [Northern
Ireland](Northern_Irish_Law "wikilink"). This is due to these areas
retaining their existing legal systems even after joining the UK.[^16]
Since 1998, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland also have their own
[devolved governments and
legislatures](Devolution_in_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink"), each with
varying powers.[^17]

The UK has the world\'s [sixth-largest economy by nominal gross domestic
product](List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal) "wikilink") (GDP), and the
[ninth-largest by purchasing power
parity](List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP) "wikilink"). It is a recognised
[nuclear state](nuclear_state "wikilink") and is ranked [fourth globally
in military
expenditure](List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures "wikilink").[^18][^19]
The UK has been [a permanent member
of](permanent_members_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council "wikilink")
the [UN Security Council](United_Nations_Security_Council "wikilink")
since its first session in 1946. It is a member of the [Commonwealth of

## Etymology and terminology {#etymology_and_terminology}

```{=mediawiki}
{{Anchor|Etymology}}
```
```{=mediawiki}
{{See also|Britain (place name)|Terminology of the British Isles}}
```
In `{{nowrap|43 AD}}`{=mediawiki}, *Britannia* referred to the [Roman
province](Roman_province "wikilink") that encompassed modern [England
and Wales](England_and_Wales "wikilink"). Great Britain encompassed the
whole island, taking in the land north of the [River
Forth](River_Forth "wikilink") known to the Romans as
[Caledonia](Caledonia "wikilink") in modern
[Scotland](Scotland "wikilink") (i.e. \"greater\" Britain).[^20] In the
[Middle Ages](Middle_Ages "wikilink"), the name \"Britain\" was also
applied to a small part of [France](France "wikilink") now known as
[Brittany](Brittany "wikilink"). As a result, [Great
Britain](Great_Britain "wikilink") (likely from the French
\"`{{lang|fr|Grande Bretagne}}`{=mediawiki}\") came into use to refer
specifically to the island, with Brittany often referred to as \"Little
Britain\".[^21] However, that name had no official significance until
1707, when the island\'s kingdoms of [England](England "wikilink") and
Scotland were united as the [Kingdom of Great
Britain](Kingdom_of_Great_Britain "wikilink").[^22]

The [Acts of Union 1707](Acts_of_Union_1707 "wikilink") declared that
the [Kingdom of England](Kingdom_of_England "wikilink") and [Kingdom of
Scotland](Kingdom_of_Scotland "wikilink") were \"United into One Kingdom
by the Name of Great
Britain\".`{{Efn|Compare to section 1 of both of the 1800 [[Acts of Union (1800)|Acts of Union]] which reads: the ''Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland shall...be united into one Kingdom, by the Name of "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland"''.}}`{=mediawiki}[^23]
The term \"United Kingdom\" has occasionally been used as a description
for the former [Kingdom of Great
Britain](Kingdom_of_Great_Britain "wikilink"), although its official
name from 1707 to 1800 was simply \"Great Britain\".[^24] The [Acts of
Union 1800](Acts_of_Union_1800 "wikilink") united the kingdoms of [Great
Britain](Great_Britain "wikilink") and
[Ireland](Kingdom_of_Ireland "wikilink") in 1801, forming the [United
Kingdom of Great Britain and
Ireland](United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland "wikilink").
Following the [partition of Ireland](partition_of_Ireland "wikilink")
and the independence of the [Irish Free
State](Irish_Free_State "wikilink") in 1922, which left [Northern
Ireland](Northern_Ireland "wikilink") as the only part of the island of
Ireland within the United Kingdom, the name was changed in 1927 to the
\"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\".[^25]

Although the United Kingdom is a sovereign country, England, Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland are also widely referred to as
[countries](countries "wikilink").[^26] The UK Prime Minister\'s website
has used the phrase \"countries within a country\" to describe the
United Kingdom.[^27] Some statistical summaries, such as those for the
twelve [NUTS 1 regions](NUTS_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") refer to
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as \"regions\".[^28] Northern
Ireland is also referred to as a \"province\".[^29] With regard to
Northern Ireland, the descriptive name used \"can be controversial, with
the choice often revealing one\'s political preferences\".[^30]

The term \"Great Britain\" conventionally refers to the island of Great
Britain, or politically to England, Scotland and Wales in
combination.[^31] It is sometimes used as a loose synonym for the United
Kingdom as a whole.[^32] The word *England* is occasionally used
incorrectly to refer to the United Kingdom as a whole, a mistake
principally made by people from outside the UK.[^33]

The [term \"Britain\"](Britain_(place_name) "wikilink") is used as a
synonym for [Great Britain](Great_Britain "wikilink"),[^34][^35] and the
United Kingdom.[^36][^37] Usage is mixed: the [UK
Government](Government_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") prefers to use
the term \"UK\" rather than \"Britain\" or \"British\" on its website
(except when referring to embassies),[^38] while acknowledging that both
terms refer to the United Kingdom and that elsewhere \"British
government\" is used at least as frequently as \"United Kingdom
government\".[^39] The UK [Permanent Committee on Geographical
Names](Permanent_Committee_on_Geographical_Names "wikilink") recognises
\"United Kingdom\", \"UK\" and \"U.K.\" as shortened and abbreviated
geopolitical terms for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland in its toponymic guidelines; it does not list \"Britain\" but
notes that \"it is only the one specific nominal term \'Great Britain\'
which invariably excludes Northern Ireland\".[^40] The
[BBC](BBC "wikilink") historically preferred to use \"Britain\" as
shorthand only for Great Britain, though the present style guide does
not take a position except that \"Great Britain\" excludes Northern
Ireland.[^41]

The adjective \"British\" is commonly used to refer to matters relating
to the United Kingdom and is used in law to refer to United Kingdom
citizenship and [matters to do with
nationality](British_nationality_law "wikilink").[^42] People of the
United Kingdom use several different terms to describe their national
identity and may identify themselves as being
[British](British_people "wikilink"),
[English](English_people "wikilink"),
[Scottish](Scottish_people "wikilink"),
[Welsh](Welsh_people "wikilink"), [Northern
Irish](People_of_Northern_Ireland "wikilink"), or
[Irish](Irish_people "wikilink");[^43] or as having a combination of
different national identities.[^44] The official designation for a
citizen of the United Kingdom is \"British citizen\".[^45]

Settlement by [Cro-Magnons](Cro-Magnons "wikilink") of what was to
become the United Kingdom occurred in waves beginning by about 30,000
years ago.[^46] By the end of the [region\'s prehistoric
period](Prehistoric_Britain "wikilink"), the population is thought to
have belonged largely to a culture termed [Insular
Celtic](Insular_Celts "wikilink"), comprising [Brittonic
Britain](Britons_(historical) "wikilink") and [Gaelic
Ireland](Gaelic_Ireland "wikilink").[^47] ![The [Roman
Baths](Roman_Baths_(Bath) "wikilink") in [Bath,
Somerset](Bath,_Somerset "wikilink"), are a well-preserved
*[thermae](thermae "wikilink")* from [Roman

The [Roman conquest](Roman_conquest_of_Britain "wikilink"), beginning in
43 AD, and the 400-year [rule of southern
Britain](Roman_Britain "wikilink"), was followed by an invasion by
[Germanic](Germanic_peoples "wikilink")
[Anglo-Saxon](Anglo-Saxon "wikilink") settlers, reducing the Brittonic
area mainly [to what was to become
Wales](Wales#Post-Roman_era "wikilink"), [Cornwall](Cornwall "wikilink")
and, until the latter stages of the Anglo-Saxon settlement, the [Hen
Ogledd](Hen_Ogledd "wikilink") (northern England and parts of southern
Scotland).[^48] Most of the [region settled by the
Anglo-Saxons](Anglo-Saxon_England "wikilink") became unified as the
Kingdom of England in the 10th century.[^49] Meanwhile, [Gaelic-speakers
in north-west Britain](Dl_Riata "wikilink") (with connections to the
north-east of Ireland and traditionally supposed to have migrated from
there in the 5th century)[^50] united with the [Picts](Picts "wikilink")
to create the [Kingdom of Scotland](Kingdom_of_Scotland "wikilink") in
the 9th century.[^51] ![The [Bayeux
Tapestry](Bayeux_Tapestry "wikilink") depicts the [Battle of
Hastings](Battle_of_Hastings "wikilink"), 1066, and the events leading
to
it.](Bayeux_Tapestry_WillelmDux.jpg "The Bayeux Tapestry depicts the Battle of Hastings, 1066, and the events leading to it.")
In 1066, the [Normans](Normans "wikilink") invaded England from northern
France. After [conquering
England](Norman_conquest_of_England "wikilink"), they seized [large
parts of Wales](Norman_invasion_of_Wales "wikilink"), [conquered much of
Ireland](Norman_invasion_of_Ireland "wikilink") and were invited to
settle in Scotland, bringing to each country
[feudalism](feudalism "wikilink") on the Northern French model and
[Norman-French](Norman-French "wikilink") culture.[^52] The
[Anglo-Norman](Anglo-Normans "wikilink") [ruling
class](ruling_class "wikilink") greatly influenced, but eventually
assimilated with, the local cultures.[^53] Subsequent [medieval English
kings](House_of_Plantagenet "wikilink") completed the [conquest of
Wales](conquest_of_Wales "wikilink") and tried unsuccessfully [to annex
Scotland](Wars_of_Scottish_Independence "wikilink"). Asserting its
independence in the 1320 [Declaration of
Arbroath](Declaration_of_Arbroath "wikilink"), Scotland maintained its
independence thereafter, albeit in [near-constant conflict with
England](Anglo-Scottish_Wars "wikilink").

The English monarchs, through inheritance of [substantial territories in
France](Angevin_Empire "wikilink") and claims to the French crown, were
also heavily involved in conflicts in France, most notably the [Hundred
Years\' War](Hundred_Years'_War "wikilink"), while the [Kings of
Scots](List_of_Scottish_monarchs "wikilink") were in [an alliance with
the French](Auld_Alliance "wikilink") during this period.[^54] [Early
modern Britain](Early_modern_Britain "wikilink") saw religious conflict
resulting from the [Reformation](Reformation "wikilink") and the
introduction of [Protestant](Protestant "wikilink") state churches in
each country.[^55] The [English
Reformation](English_Reformation "wikilink") ushered in political,
constitutional, social and cultural change in the 16th century and
[established](State_religion "wikilink") the [Church of
England](Church_of_England "wikilink"). Moreover, it defined a national
identity for England and slowly, but profoundly, changed people\'s
religious beliefs.[^56] Wales was [fully incorporated into the Kingdom
of England](Laws_in_Wales_Acts_15351542 "wikilink"),[^57] and Ireland
was constituted as a kingdom in personal union with the English
crown.[^58] In what was to become Northern Ireland, the lands of the
independent Catholic Gaelic nobility were confiscated and [given to
Protestant settlers](Plantation_of_Ulster "wikilink") from England and
Scotland.[^59]

In 1603, the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland were united in a
[personal union](personal_union "wikilink") when [James VI, King of
Scots](James_I_of_England "wikilink"), inherited the crowns of England
and Ireland and moved his court from [Edinburgh](Edinburgh "wikilink")
to London; each country nevertheless remained a separate political
entity and retained its separate political, legal, and religious
institutions.[^60]

In the mid-17th century, all three kingdoms [were involved in a series
of connected wars](Wars_of_the_Three_Kingdoms "wikilink") (including the
[English Civil War](English_Civil_War "wikilink")) which led to the
temporary overthrow of the monarchy, with the [execution of King Charles
I](execution_of_Charles_I "wikilink"), and the establishment of the
short-lived [unitary republic](unitary_republic "wikilink") of the
[Commonwealth of England](Commonwealth_of_England "wikilink"), Scotland
and Ireland.[^61]

Although the [monarchy was restored](Restoration_(1660) "wikilink"), the
[Interregnum](Interregnum_(16491660) "wikilink") along with the
[Glorious Revolution](Glorious_Revolution "wikilink") of 1688 and the
subsequent [Bill of Rights 1689](Bill_of_Rights_1689 "wikilink") in
England and [Claim of Right Act
1689](Claim_of_Right_Act_1689 "wikilink") in Scotland ensured that,
unlike much of the rest of Europe, [royal
absolutism](royal_absolutism "wikilink") would not prevail, and a
professed Catholic could never accede to the throne. The [British
constitution](British_constitution "wikilink") would develop on the
basis of [constitutional monarchy](constitutional_monarchy "wikilink")
and the [parliamentary system](parliamentary_system "wikilink").[^62]
With the founding of the [Royal Society](Royal_Society "wikilink") in
1660, science was greatly encouraged. During this period, particularly
in England, the development of [naval power](English_navy "wikilink")
and the interest in [voyages of discovery](Age_of_Discovery "wikilink")
led to the acquisition and settlement of [overseas
colonies](First_British_Empire "wikilink"), particularly in North
America and the Caribbean.[^63]

Though previous attempts at uniting the two kingdoms within Great
Britain in 1606, 1667, and 1689 had proved unsuccessful, the attempt
initiated in 1705 led to the [Treaty of
Union](Treaty_of_Union "wikilink") of 1706 being agreed and ratified by
both parliaments. `{{Clear left}}`{=mediawiki}

### Kingdom of Great Britain {#kingdom_of_great_britain}

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Treaty of Union|Kingdom of Great Britain}}
```
![The [Treaty of Union](Treaty_of_Union "wikilink") led to a united
kingdom of all of [Great
Britain](Great_Britain "wikilink").](Treaty_of_Union.jpg "The Treaty of Union led to a united kingdom of all of Great Britain.")
On 1 May 1707, the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed, the result of
the [Acts of Union 1707](Acts_of_Union_1707 "wikilink").[^64]

In the 18th century, cabinet government developed under [Robert
Walpole](Robert_Walpole "wikilink"), in practice the first prime
minister (1721--1742). A series of [Jacobite
uprisings](Jacobite_uprisings "wikilink") sought to remove the
Protestant [House of Hanover](House_of_Hanover "wikilink") from the
throne and restore the Catholic [House of
Stuart](House_of_Stuart "wikilink"). The Jacobites were finally defeated
at the [Battle of Culloden](Battle_of_Culloden "wikilink") in 1746,
after which the [Scottish Highlanders](Scottish_Highlanders "wikilink")
were forcibly assimilated into Scotland by revoking the feudal
independence of [clan chiefs](Scottish_clan_chief "wikilink"). The
British colonies in North America that broke away in the [American War
of Independence](American_Revolutionary_War "wikilink") became the
[United States](United_States "wikilink"), recognised by Britain in
1783. British imperial ambition turned towards Asia, particularly to
[India](India "wikilink").[^65]

Britain played a leading part in the [Atlantic slave
trade](Atlantic_slave_trade "wikilink"), mainly between 1662 and 1807
when British or British-colonial [slave ships](slave_ships "wikilink")
transported nearly 3.3 million slaves from Africa.[^66] The slaves were
taken to work on [plantations](Plantation_economy "wikilink"),
principally in the
[Caribbean](History_of_the_British_West_Indies "wikilink") but also
[North America](British_America "wikilink").[^67] Slavery coupled with
the [Caribbean sugar
industry](Sugar_plantations_in_the_Caribbean "wikilink") had a
significant role in strengthening the British economy in the 18th
century.[^68] However, with pressure from the [abolitionism
movement](Abolitionism_in_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink"), Parliament
banned the trade in 1807, banned slavery in the British Empire in 1833,
and Britain took a role in the movement to abolish slavery worldwide
through the [blockade of Africa](blockade_of_Africa "wikilink") and
pressing other nations to end their trade with a series of
treaties.[^69]

### United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland {#united_kingdom_of_great_britain_and_ireland}

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|History of the United Kingdom|Acts of Union (1800)|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland}}
```
In 1800 the parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland each passed an Act
of Union, uniting the two kingdoms and creating the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland on 1 January 1801.[^70] ![The opening
engagement at the [Battle of Trafalgar](Battle_of_Trafalgar "wikilink"),
by [J.W.
Carmichael](James_Wilson_Carmichael "wikilink")](John_Wilson_Carmichael_-_The_opening_engagement_at_Trafalgar;_H.M.S._'Royal_Sovereign'_raking_the_stern_of_the_Spanish_flagship_'Santa_Ana'.jpg "The opening engagement at the Battle of Trafalgar, by J.W. Carmichael")
After the defeat of France at the end of the [French Revolutionary
Wars](French_Revolutionary_Wars "wikilink") and [Napoleonic
Wars](Napoleonic_Wars "wikilink") (1792--1815), the United Kingdom
emerged as the principal naval and imperial power (with London the
largest city in the world from about 1830).[^71] [Unchallenged at
sea](Royal_Navy#18151914 "wikilink"), British dominance was later
described as *[Pax Britannica](Pax_Britannica "wikilink")* (\"British
Peace\"), a period of [relative peace among the great
powers](International_relations_of_the_Great_Powers_(18141919) "wikilink")
(1815--1914) during which the [British
Empire](British_Empire "wikilink") became the global
[hegemon](hegemon "wikilink") and adopted the role of global
policeman.[^72] By the time of [the Great
Exhibition](the_Great_Exhibition "wikilink") of 1851, Britain was
described as the \"workshop of the world\".[^73] From 1853 to 1856,
Britain took part in the [Crimean War](Crimean_War "wikilink"), allied
with the [Ottoman Empire](Ottoman_Empire "wikilink") against [Tsarist
Russia](Russian_Empire "wikilink"),[^74] participating in the naval
battles of the [Baltic Sea](Baltic_Sea "wikilink") known as the [land
War](land_War "wikilink") in the [Gulf of
Bothnia](Gulf_of_Bothnia "wikilink") and the [Gulf of
Finland](Gulf_of_Finland "wikilink"), among others.[^75] Following the
[Indian Rebellion in 1857](Indian_Rebellion_of_1857 "wikilink"), the
British government led by [Lord
Palmerston](Henry_John_Temple,_3rd_Viscount_Palmerston "wikilink")
assumed [direct rule](direct_rule "wikilink") over
[India](British_Raj "wikilink"). Alongside the formal control it exerted
over its own colonies, British dominance of much of world trade meant
that it effectively [controlled the
economies](Informal_Empire "wikilink") of regions such as [East
Asia](East_Asia "wikilink") and [Latin
America](Latin_America "wikilink").[^76]

![[Victoria](Queen_Victoria "wikilink") reigned as [Queen of the United
Kingdom](Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") and [Empress of
India](Empress_of_India "wikilink") during the 19th
century.](Queen_Victoria_Statue.png "Victoria reigned as Queen of the United Kingdom and Empress of India during the 19th century.")Throughout
the [Victorian era](Victorian_era "wikilink"), political attitudes
favoured [free trade](free_trade "wikilink") and
[laissez-faire](laissez-faire "wikilink") policies, as well as a
[gradual widening of the voting franchise](Reform_Acts "wikilink"), with
the [1884 Reform Act](Representation_of_the_People_Act_1884 "wikilink")
championed by [William Gladstone](William_Ewart_Gladstone "wikilink")
granting [suffrage](suffrage "wikilink") to a majority of males for the
first time. The British population increased at a dramatic rate,
accompanied by rapid [urbanisation](Urbanization "wikilink"), causing
significant social and economic stresses.[^77] By the late 19th century,
the [Conservatives](Conservative_Party_(UK) "wikilink") under [Benjamin
Disraeli](Benjamin_Disraeli "wikilink") and [Lord
Salisbury](Robert_Gascoyne-Cecil,_3rd_Marquess_of_Salisbury "wikilink")
initiated a period of [imperial expansion in
Africa](Scramble_for_Africa "wikilink"), maintained a policy of
[splendid isolation](splendid_isolation "wikilink") in Europe, and
attempted to contain Russian influence in
[Afghanistan](Emirate_of_Afghanistan "wikilink") and
[Persia](Qajar_Iran "wikilink"), in what came to be known as the [Great
Game](Great_Game "wikilink").[^78] During this time,
[Canada](Canada "wikilink"), [Australia](Australia "wikilink") and [New
Zealand](New_Zealand "wikilink") were granted self-governing
[dominion](dominion "wikilink") status.[^79] At the turn of the century,
Britain\'s industrial dominance became challenged by the [German
Empire](German_Empire "wikilink") and the [United
States](United_States "wikilink").[^80] The [Edwardian
era](Edwardian_era "wikilink") saw [social
reform](Liberal_welfare_reforms "wikilink") and [home rule for
Ireland](Irish_Home_Rule_movement "wikilink") become important domestic
issues, while the [Labour Party](Labour_Party_(UK) "wikilink") emerged
from an alliance of [trade
unions](Trade_unions_in_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") and small
socialist groups in 1900, and [suffragettes](suffragettes "wikilink")
campaigned for women\'s right to vote.[^81]

Britain was one of the principal
[Allies](Allies_of_World_War_I "wikilink") that defeated the [Central
Powers](Central_Powers "wikilink") in the [First World
War](First_World_War "wikilink") (1914--1918). Alongside their French,
Russian and (after 1917) American counterparts,[^82] British armed
forces were engaged across much of the British Empire and in several
regions of Europe, particularly on the [Western
Front](Western_Front_(World_War_I) "wikilink").[^83] The high fatalities
of [trench warfare](trench_warfare "wikilink") caused the loss of much
of a generation of men, with lasting social effects in the nation and a
great disruption in the social order. Britain had suffered 2.5 million
casualties and finished the war with a huge national debt.[^84] The
consequences of the war persuaded the government to expand the right to
vote in national and local elections with the [Representation of the
People Act 1918](Representation_of_the_People_Act_1918 "wikilink").[^85]
After the war, Britain became a permanent member of the Executive
Council of the [League of Nations](League_of_Nations "wikilink") and
received a [mandate](League_of_Nations_mandate "wikilink") over a number
of former German and [Ottoman](Ottoman_Empire "wikilink") colonies.
Under the leadership of [David Lloyd
George](David_Lloyd_George "wikilink"), the British Empire reached its
greatest extent, covering a fifth of the world\'s land surface and a
quarter of its population.[^86]

By the mid-1920s, most of the British population could listen to
[BBC](BBC "wikilink") radio programmes.[^87][^88] Experimental
television broadcasts [began in
1929](History_of_television#United_Kingdom "wikilink") and the [first
scheduled BBC Television
Service](First_day_of_BBC_television "wikilink") commenced in 1936.[^89]
The rise of [Irish nationalism](Irish_nationalism "wikilink"), and
disputes within Ireland over the terms of [Irish Home
Rule](Irish_Home_Rule "wikilink"), led eventually to the [partition of
the island](Partition_of_Ireland "wikilink") in 1921.[^90] The [Irish
Free State](Irish_Free_State "wikilink") became independent, initially
with [Dominion](Dominion "wikilink") status in 1922, and [unambiguously
independent in
1931](Statute_of_Westminster_1931#Irish_Free_State "wikilink"). Northern
Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom.[^91] The [1928 Equal
Franchise Act](1928_Equal_Franchise_Act "wikilink") gave women electoral
equality with men in national elections. Strikes in the mid-1920s
culminated in the [General Strike of
1926](General_Strike_of_1926 "wikilink"), which ended in a victory for
the government led by [Stanley Baldwin](Stanley_Baldwin "wikilink").
Britain had still not recovered from the effects of the First World War
when the [Great
Depression](Great_Depression_in_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink")
(1929--1932) led to considerable unemployment and hardship in the old
industrial areas, as well as political and social unrest with rising
membership in communist and socialist parties. A [coalition
government](National_Government_(1931) "wikilink") was formed in
1931.[^92] ![[Spitfire](Supermarine_Spitfire "wikilink") and
[Hurricane](Hawker_Hurricane "wikilink") as flown in the [Battle of

War](Second_World_War "wikilink")](Spitfire_and_Hurricane_in_the_Battle_of_Britain_Memorial_Flight.jpg "Spitfire and Hurricane as flown in the Battle of Britain during the Second World War")

Nonetheless, \"Britain was a very wealthy country, formidable in arms,
ruthless in pursuit of its interests and sitting at the heart of a
global production system.\"[^93] After [Nazi
Germany](Nazi_Germany "wikilink") invaded Poland in 1939, Britain
entered the [Second World War](Second_World_War "wikilink"). [Winston
Churchill](Winston_Churchill "wikilink") became prime minister and head
of a [coalition government](Churchill_war_ministry "wikilink") in 1940.
Despite the defeat of its European allies in the first year, Britain and
its Empire continued the war against Germany. Churchill engaged
industry, scientists and engineers to support the government and the
military in the prosecution of the war effort.[^94]

In 1940, the [Royal Air Force](Royal_Air_Force "wikilink") defeated the
German [Luftwaffe](Luftwaffe "wikilink") in the [Battle of
Britain](Battle_of_Britain "wikilink"). Urban areas suffered heavy
bombing during [the Blitz](the_Blitz "wikilink"). The [Grand
Alliance](Grand_Alliance_(World_War_II) "wikilink") of Britain, the
United States and the [Soviet Union](Soviet_Union "wikilink") formed in
1941, leading the [Allies](Allies_of_World_War_II "wikilink") against
the [Axis powers](Axis_powers "wikilink"). There were eventual
hard-fought victories in the [Battle of the
Atlantic](Battle_of_the_Atlantic "wikilink"), the [North Africa
campaign](North_Africa_campaign "wikilink") and the [Italian
campaign](Italian_campaign_(World_War_II) "wikilink"). British forces
played important roles in the [Normandy
landings](Normandy_landings "wikilink") of 1944 and the [liberation of
Europe](liberation_of_Europe "wikilink"). The British Army led the
[Burma campaign](Burma_campaign "wikilink") against Japan, and the
[British Pacific Fleet](British_Pacific_Fleet "wikilink") fought Japan
at sea. British scientists [contributed to the Manhattan
Project](British_contribution_to_the_Manhattan_Project "wikilink") whose
task was to build an atomic weapon.[^95] Once built, it was decided,
with British consent, to use the weapon against Japan.[^96] The wartime
net losses in British national wealth amounted to 18.6% (4.595 billion)
of the prewar wealth (24.68 billion), at 1938 prices.[^97]

The UK was one of the [Big Three](Big_Three_(World_War_II) "wikilink")
powers (along with the US and the Soviet Union) who met to plan the
post-war world;[^98] it was an original signatory to the [Declaration by
United Nations](Declaration_by_United_Nations "wikilink") and became one
of the five permanent members of the [United Nations Security
Council](United_Nations_Security_Council "wikilink"). It worked closely
with the United States to establish the [IMF](IMF "wikilink"), [World
Bank](World_Bank "wikilink") and [NATO](NATO "wikilink").[^99] The war
left the UK severely weakened and financially dependent on the [Marshall
Plan](Marshall_Plan "wikilink"),[^100] but it was spared the total war
that devastated eastern Europe.[^101]

In the immediate post-war years, the [Labour
government](Labour_Government_19451951 "wikilink") under [Clement
Attlee](Clement_Attlee "wikilink") initiated a radical programme of
reforms, which significantly impacted British society [in the following
decades](Post-war_consensus "wikilink").[^102] Major industries and
public utilities were [nationalised](Nationalization "wikilink"), a
[welfare state](welfare_state "wikilink") was established, and a
comprehensive, publicly funded healthcare system, the [National Health
Service](National_Health_Service "wikilink"), was created.[^103] The
rise of nationalism in the colonies coincided with Britain\'s
much-diminished economic position, so that a policy of
[decolonisation](decolonisation "wikilink") was unavoidable.
Independence was granted to India and Pakistan in 1947.[^104] Over the
next three decades, most colonies of the British Empire gained their
independence, and many became members of the [Commonwealth of
Nations](Commonwealth_of_Nations "wikilink").[^105]

![[Concorde](Concorde "wikilink") was a
[supersonic](Supersonic_speed "wikilink") airliner that reduced
transatlantic flight time from 8 hours to 3.5
hours.[^106]](British_Airways_Concorde_G-BOAC_03.jpg "Concorde was a supersonic airliner that reduced transatlantic flight time from 8 hours to 3.5 hours.")
The UK was the third country to develop [a nuclear weapons
arsenal](Nuclear_weapons_and_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") (with its
first atomic bomb test, [Operation
Hurricane](Operation_Hurricane "wikilink"), in 1952), but the post-war
limits of Britain\'s international role were illustrated by the [Suez
Crisis](Suez_Crisis "wikilink") of 1956. The [international spread of
the English language](English-speaking_world "wikilink") ensured the
continuing international influence of its
[literature](British_literature "wikilink") and
[culture](Culture_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink").[^108][^109] As a
result of a shortage of workers in the 1950s, the government encouraged
immigration from [Commonwealth
countries](Commonwealth_countries "wikilink"). In the following decades,
the UK became a more multi-ethnic society.[^110] Despite rising living
standards in the late 1950s and 1960s, the UK\'s economic performance
was less successful than many of its main competitors such as France,
[West Germany](West_Germany "wikilink") and Japan.

In the decades-long process of [European
integration](European_integration "wikilink"), the UK was a founding
member of the [Western European
Union](Western_European_Union "wikilink"), established with the [London
and Paris Conferences](London_and_Paris_Conferences "wikilink") in 1954.
In 1960 the UK was one of the seven founding members of the [European
Free Trade Association](European_Free_Trade_Association "wikilink")
(EFTA), but in 1973 it left to join the [European
Communities](European_Communities "wikilink") (EC). In a [1975
referendum](1975_United_Kingdom_European_Communities_membership_referendum "wikilink")
67% voted to stay in it.[^111] When the EC became the [European
Union](European_Union "wikilink") (EU) in 1992, the UK was one of the 12
founding member states.

From the late 1960s, Northern Ireland suffered communal and paramilitary
violence (sometimes affecting other parts of the UK) conventionally
known as [the Troubles](the_Troubles "wikilink"). It is usually
considered to have ended with the 1998 [Belfast \"Good Friday\"
Agreement](Belfast_Agreement "wikilink").[^112] ![[Canary
Wharf](Canary_Wharf "wikilink"), a symbol of [the financial
reforms](Big_Bang_(financial_markets) "wikilink") initiated by [Margaret

Following a period of widespread economic slowdown and industrial strife
in the 1970s, the [Conservative](Conservative_Party_(UK) "wikilink")
government of the 1980s led by [Margaret
Thatcher](Margaret_Thatcher "wikilink") initiated a radical policy of
[monetarism](monetarism "wikilink"), deregulation, particularly of the
financial sector (for example, the [Big
Bang](Big_Bang_(financial_markets) "wikilink") in 1986) and labour
markets, the sale of state-owned companies (privatisation), and the
withdrawal of subsidies to others.[^113]

In 1982, [Argentina](Argentina "wikilink") invaded the British
territories of [South
Georgia](South_Georgia_and_the_South_Sandwich_Islands "wikilink") and
the [Falkland Islands](Falkland_Islands "wikilink"), leading to the
10-week [Falklands War](Falklands_War "wikilink") in which Argentine
forces were defeated. The inhabitants of the islands are predominantly
descendants of British settlers, and strongly favour British
sovereignty, expressed in a [2013
referendum](2013_Falkland_Islands_sovereignty_referendum "wikilink").
From 1984, the UK economy was helped by the inflow of substantial [North
Sea oil](North_Sea_oil "wikilink") revenues.[^114]

Around the end of the 20th century, there were major changes to the
governance of the UK with the establishment of
[devolved](devolution "wikilink") administrations for Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland.[^115] The [statutory
incorporation](Human_Rights_Act_1998 "wikilink") followed acceptance of
the [European Convention on Human
Rights](European_Convention_on_Human_Rights "wikilink"). The UK remained
a [great power](List_of_modern_great_powers#United_Kingdom "wikilink")
with global diplomatic and military influence and a leading role in the
United Nations and [NATO](NATO "wikilink").[^116]

Studies have suggested that policy led to significant social disruption
and suffering.[^121][^122] A referendum on [Scottish
independence](Scottish_independence "wikilink") in 2014 resulted in the
Scottish electorate [voting by 55.3 to
44.7%](2014_Scottish_independence_referendum "wikilink") to remain part
of the United Kingdom.[^123]

In 2016, 51.9 per cent of voters in the United Kingdom [voted to leave

![[Satellite image](Satellite_image "wikilink") of the United Kingdom
(excluding
[Shetland](Shetland "wikilink"))](MODIS_-_Great_Britain_and_Northern_Ireland_-_2012-06-04_during_heat_wave_(cropped).jpg "Satellite image of the United Kingdom (excluding Shetland)")
The total area of the United Kingdom is approximately
`{{Convert|244376|km2|sqmi|order=flip}}`{=mediawiki},`{{efn|name=ONSArea}}`{=mediawiki}[^134]
with a land area of
`{{convert|242741|km2|sqmi|order=flip}}`{=mediawiki}.[^135] The country
occupies the major part of the [British
Isles](British_Isles "wikilink")[^136] archipelago and includes the
island of Great Britain, the north-eastern one-sixth of the island of
Ireland and some smaller surrounding islands. It lies between the North
Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea with the southeast coast coming within
`{{Convert|35|km|mi|0|order=flip}}`{=mediawiki} of the coast of northern
France, from which it is separated by the [English
Channel](English_Channel "wikilink").[^137]

The [Royal Greenwich
Observatory](Royal_Observatory,_Greenwich "wikilink") in London was
chosen as the defining point of the [Prime
Meridian](Prime_Meridian "wikilink")[^138] at the [International
Meridian Conference](International_Meridian_Conference "wikilink") in
1884.[^139]

The United Kingdom lies between latitudes
[49](49th_parallel_north "wikilink") and [61
N](61st_parallel_north "wikilink"), and longitudes [9
W](9th_meridian_west "wikilink") and [2
E](2nd_meridian_east "wikilink"). Northern Ireland shares a
`{{Convert|360|km|mi|0|adj=on|order=flip}}`{=mediawiki} land boundary
with the Republic of Ireland.[^140] The coastline of Great Britain is
`{{Convert|17820|km|mi|0|order=flip}}`{=mediawiki} long.[^141] It is
connected to continental Europe by the [Channel
Tunnel](Channel_Tunnel "wikilink"), which at
`{{Convert|50|km|mi|0|order=flip}}`{=mediawiki}
(`{{Convert|38|km|mi|0|order=flip}}`{=mediawiki} underwater) is the
longest underwater tunnel in the world.[^142]

The UK contains four terrestrial ecoregions: [Celtic broadleaf
forests](Celtic_broadleaf_forests "wikilink"), [English Lowlands beech
forests](English_Lowlands_beech_forests "wikilink"), [North Atlantic
moist mixed forests](North_Atlantic_moist_mixed_forests "wikilink"), and
[Caledon conifer forests](Caledon_conifer_forests "wikilink").[^143] The
area of woodland in the UK in 2023 is estimated to be 3.25 million
hectares, which represents 13% of the total land area in the UK.[^144]

### Climate

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Climate of the United Kingdom|Climate change in the United Kingdom}}
```
![[Kppen climate types](Kppen_climate_classification "wikilink") of
the UK](UK_Kppen.svg "Kppen climate types of the UK") Most of the
United Kingdom has a temperate climate, with generally cool temperatures
and plentiful rainfall all year round.[^145] The temperature varies with
the seasons seldom dropping below `{{Convert|0|C|lk=on}}`{=mediawiki} or
rising above `{{Convert|30|C}}`{=mediawiki}.[^146] Some parts, away from
the coast, of upland England, Wales, Northern Ireland and most of
Scotland, experience a [subpolar oceanic
climate](subpolar_oceanic_climate "wikilink") (*Cfc*). Higher elevations
in Scotland experience a [continental subarctic
climate](Subarctic_climate "wikilink") (*Dfc*) and the mountains
experience a [tundra climate](tundra_climate "wikilink") (*ET*).[^147]

The prevailing wind is from the southwest and bears frequent spells of
mild and wet weather from the Atlantic Ocean,[^148] although the eastern
parts are mostly sheltered from this wind. Since the majority of the
rain falls over the western regions, the eastern parts are the driest.
Atlantic currents, warmed by the [Gulf Stream](Gulf_Stream "wikilink"),
bring mild winters, especially in the west where winters are wet and
even more so over high ground. Summers are warmest in the southeast of
England and coolest in the north. Heavy snowfall can occur in winter and
early spring on high ground, and occasionally settles to great depth
away from the hills.[^149]

The average total annual sunshine in the United Kingdom is 1339.7 hours,
which is just under 30% of the maximum possible.[^150] The hours of
sunshine vary from 1200 to about 1580 hours per year, and since 1996 the
UK has been and still is receiving above the 1981 to 2010 average hours
of sunshine.[^151]

As of 2022, the United Kingdom is ranked 2nd out of 180 countries in the
[Environmental Performance
Index](Environmental_Performance_Index "wikilink").[^152] A law has been
passed that [UK greenhouse gas
emissions](Greenhouse_gas_emissions_by_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink")
will be [net zero](net_zero "wikilink") by 2050.[^153]

### Topography

[England](Geography_of_England "wikilink") accounts for 53 per cent of
the UK, covering
`{{Convert|130395|km2|sqmi|order=flip|-1}}`{=mediawiki}.[^154] Most of
the country consists of lowland terrain,[^155] with upland and
mountainous terrain northwest of the [Tees--Exe
line](TeesExe_line "wikilink") which roughly divides the UK into
lowland and upland areas. Lowland areas include
[Cornwall](Cornwall "wikilink"), the [New
Forest](New_Forest "wikilink"), the [South
Downs](South_Downs "wikilink") and the [Norfolk
Broads](The_Broads "wikilink"). Upland areas include the [Lake
District](Lake_District "wikilink"), the
[Pennines](Pennines "wikilink"), the [Yorkshire
Dales](Yorkshire_Dales "wikilink"), [Exmoor](Exmoor "wikilink"), and
[Dartmoor](Dartmoor "wikilink"). The main rivers and estuaries are the
[Thames](River_Thames "wikilink"), [Severn](River_Severn "wikilink"),
and the [Humber](Humber "wikilink"). England\'s highest mountain is
[Scafell Pike](Scafell_Pike "wikilink"), at
`{{Convert|978|m|ft|0}}`{=mediawiki} in the Lake District; its largest
island is the [Isle of Wight](Isle_of_Wight "wikilink").

```
[Scotland](Geography_of_Scotland "wikilink") accounts for 32 per cent of
the UK, covering
`{{Convert|78772|km2|sqmi|order=flip|-1}}`{=mediawiki}.[^156] This
includes nearly 800
[islands](List_of_islands_of_Scotland "wikilink"),[^157] notably the
[Hebrides](Hebrides "wikilink"), [Orkney](Orkney "wikilink") Islands and
[Shetland](Shetland "wikilink") Islands. Scotland is the most
mountainous constituent country of the UK, the
[Highlands](Scottish_Highlands "wikilink") to the north and west are the
more rugged region containing the majority of Scotland\'s mountainous
land, including the [Cairngorms](Cairngorms "wikilink"), [Loch Lomond
and The Trossachs](Loch_Lomond_and_The_Trossachs "wikilink") and [Ben
Nevis](Ben_Nevis "wikilink") which at
`{{Convert|1345|m|ft|0}}`{=mediawiki}[^158] is the highest point in the
British Isles.[^159]

[Wales](Geography_of_Wales "wikilink") accounts for less than 9 per cent
of the UK, covering
`{{Convert|20779|km2|sqmi|order=flip|-1}}`{=mediawiki}.[^160] Wales is
mostly mountainous, though [South Wales](South_Wales "wikilink") is less
mountainous than [North](North_Wales "wikilink") and [mid
Wales](mid_Wales "wikilink"). The highest mountains in Wales are in
[Snowdonia](Snowdonia "wikilink") and include
[Snowdon](Snowdon "wikilink") (`{{Lang-cy|Yr Wyddfa}}`{=mediawiki})
which, at `{{Convert|1085|m|ft|0}}`{=mediawiki}, is the highest peak in
Wales.[^161] Wales has over `{{Convert|1680|mi|0|abbr=off}}`{=mediawiki}
of coastline including the [Pembrokeshire
Coast](Pembrokeshire_Coast "wikilink").[^162] Several islands lie off
the Welsh mainland, the largest of which is
[Anglesey](Anglesey "wikilink") (*Ynys Mn*).

[Northern Ireland](Geography_of_Ireland "wikilink"), separated from
Great Britain by the [Irish Sea](Irish_Sea "wikilink") and [North
Channel](North_Channel_(Great_Britain_and_Ireland) "wikilink"), has an
area of `{{Convert|14160|km2|sqmi|order=flip|-1}}`{=mediawiki} and is
mostly hilly. It includes [Lough Neagh](Lough_Neagh "wikilink") which,
at `{{Convert|388|km2|sqmi|order=flip|0}}`{=mediawiki}, is the largest
lake in the British Isles by area,[^163] [Lough
Erne](Lough_Erne "wikilink") which has over 150 islands and the
[Giant\'s Causeway](Giant's_Causeway "wikilink") which is a World
Heritage Site. The highest peak in Northern Ireland is [Slieve
Donard](Slieve_Donard "wikilink") in the [Mourne
Mountains](Mourne_Mountains "wikilink") at
`{{Convert|852|m|ft|0}}`{=mediawiki}.[^164]

The UK is a [constitutional
monarchy](constitutional_monarchy "wikilink") and a [parliamentary
democracy](parliamentary_democracy "wikilink") operating under the
[Westminster system](Westminster_system "wikilink"), otherwise known as
a \"democratic parliamentary monarchy\".[^165] It is a
[centralised](Centralized_government "wikilink"), [unitary
state](unitary_state "wikilink")[^166][^167] wherein the [Parliament of
the United Kingdom](Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") is
[sovereign](Parliamentary_sovereignty_in_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink").[^168]
Parliament is made up of the elected [House of
Commons](House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink"), the
appointed [House of Lords](House_of_Lords "wikilink") and [the
Crown](the_Crown "wikilink") (as personified by the
[monarch](Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink")).`{{Efn|British [[sovereignty]] derives from the Crown, a [[corporation sole]] occupied by the monarch. It is therefore by and through the monarch that Parliament exercises supreme legislative authority over both the executive and judiciary. Distinguished Professor of [[Public Law]] Maurice Sunkin opined the Crown symbolically occupies "what in other places would be a core element of a written constitution."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibanet.org/Relationship-between-UK-Crown-and-law-in-focus-as-Carolean-era-begins|title=Relationship between UK Crown and law in focus as Carolean era begins|author=Polly Botsford|publisher=International Bar Association|publication-date=22 September 2022|access-date=4 July 2023}}</ref> As a result of this state of constitutional affairs, the monarch is formally referred to as "[[Sovereign|the Sovereign]]" in legislation.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1978/30/section/10|title=Interpretation Act 1978 (c. 30, s. 10)|publisher=The National Archives|access-date=4 July 2023}}</ref>}}`{=mediawiki}[^169]
The main business of parliament takes place in the two houses,[^170] but
[royal assent](royal_assent "wikilink") is required for a bill to become
an [act of parliament](Act_of_Parliament_(UK) "wikilink") (that is,
[statute law](statute_law "wikilink")).[^171] As a result of
parliamentary sovereignty, the [British
constitution](Constitution_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") is
[uncodified](Uncodified_constitution "wikilink"), consisting mostly of
disparate written sources, including parliamentary
[statutes](statute "wikilink"), judge-made [case
law](case_law "wikilink") and international treaties, together with
[constitutional
conventions](British_Constitution#Conventions "wikilink").[^172]
Nevertheless, the [Supreme
Court](Supreme_Court_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") recognises a
number of principles underlying the British constitution, such as
[parliamentary
sovereignty](Parliamentary_sovereignty_in_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink"),
the [rule of law](rule_of_law "wikilink"),
[democracy](democracy "wikilink"), and upholding [international
law](Internationalism_(politics) "wikilink").[^173]

[King Charles III](Charles_III "wikilink") is the current
[monarch](Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") and [head of
state](head_of_state "wikilink") of the UK and of 14 other independent
countries. These 15 countries are today referred to as \"[Commonwealth
realms](Commonwealth_realm "wikilink")\". The monarch is formally vested
with all executive authority as the personal embodiment of the Crown and
is \"\...fundamental to the law and working of government in the
UK.\"[^174] The disposition of such powers however, including those
belonging to the [royal
prerogative](Royal_prerogative_in_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink"), is
generally exercised only on the
[advice](Advice_(constitutional_law) "wikilink") of [ministers of the
Crown](ministers_of_the_Crown "wikilink") responsible to Parliament and
thence to the electorate. Nevertheless, in the performance of official
duties, the monarch has \"the right to be consulted, the right to
encourage, and the right to warn\".[^175] In addition, the monarch has a
number of [reserve powers](Reserve_power#United_Kingdom "wikilink") at
his disposal, albeit rarely used, to uphold [responsible
government](responsible_government "wikilink") and prevent
[constitutional
crises](constitutional_crisis "wikilink").`{{Efn|For instance, the monarch alone appoints the prime minister and confers [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|state honours]] in the personal gift of the Crown. When necessary, the monarch may also refuse a [[dissolution of Parliament|dissolution]] or [[Prorogation in the United Kingdom|prorogation of Parliament]], withhold [[royal assent]] to [[Act of Parliament (UK)|primary legislation]], and prevent illegal use of the [[British Armed Forces]], among other reserve powers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-8885/CBP-8885.pdf|title=The Crown and the Constitution|author=David Torrance|publisher=House of Commons Library|publication-date=11 January 2023|access-date=19 June 2023|pages=22}}</ref>}}`{=mediawiki}

For [general
elections](General_elections_in_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink")
(elections to the House of Commons), the UK is currently divided into
650 [constituencies](United_Kingdom_constituencies "wikilink"), each of
which is represented by one [member of
Parliament](Member_of_Parliament_(United_Kingdom) "wikilink") (MP)
elected by the
[first-past-the-post](First-past-the-post_voting "wikilink")
system.[^176] MPs hold office for up to five years and must then stand
for re-election if they wish to continue to be an MP.[^177] The
[Conservative Party](Conservative_Party_(UK) "wikilink"), colloquially
known as the Tory Party or the Tories, and the [Labour
Party](Labour_Party_(UK) "wikilink") have been the dominant political
parties in the UK since the 1920s, leading to the UK being described as
a [two-party system](two-party_system "wikilink"). However, since the
1920s other [political
parties](List_of_political_parties_in_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink")
have won seats in the House of Commons, although never more than the
Conservatives or Labour.[^178]

The [prime minister](Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") is
the [head of government](head_of_government "wikilink") in the UK.[^179]
Acting under the direction and supervision of a
[Cabinet](Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") of senior ministers
selected and led by the prime minister, the
[Government](Government_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") serves as the
principal instrument for public policymaking, administers public
services and, through the [Privy
Council](Privy_Council_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink"), promulgates
[statutory instruments](statutory_instrument_(UK) "wikilink") and
tenders advice to the monarch.[^180][^181][^182] Nearly all prime
ministers have served concurrently as [First Lord of the
Treasury](First_Lord_of_the_Treasury "wikilink")[^183] and all prime
ministers have continuously served as First Lord of the Treasury since
1905,[^184] [Minister for the Civil
Service](Minister_for_the_Civil_Service "wikilink") since 1968,[^185]
and [Minister for the Union](Minister_for_the_Union "wikilink") since
2019.[^186] While appointed by the monarch, in modern times the prime
minister is, by
[convention](Constitutional_conventions_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink"),
an MP, the leader of the [political
party](Political_Parties_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") with the most
seats in the House of Commons, and holds office by virtue of their
ability to command the confidence of the House of
Commons.[^187][^188][^189] The current Prime Minister, as of October
2022, is [Rishi Sunak](Rishi_Sunak "wikilink") MP, leader of the
[Conservative Party](Conservative_Party_(UK) "wikilink").

### Administrative divisions {#administrative_divisions}

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Countries of the United Kingdom|Administrative geography of the United Kingdom|List of counties in the United Kingdom}}
```
The geographical division of the United Kingdom into
[counties](Counties_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") or shires began in
England and Scotland in the early Middle Ages, and was completed
throughout Great Britain and Ireland by the early Modern Period.[^190]
Modern local government by elected councils, partly based on the ancient
counties, was established by separate Acts of Parliament: in England and
Wales in [1888](Local_Government_Act_1888 "wikilink"), Scotland in
[1889](Local_Government_(Scotland)_Act_1889 "wikilink") and Ireland in
[1898](Local_Government_(Ireland)_Act_1898 "wikilink"), meaning there is
no consistent system of administrative or geographic demarcation across
the UK.[^191] Until the 19th century there was little change to those
arrangements, but there has since been a constant evolution of role and
function.[^192]

[Local government in England](Local_government_in_England "wikilink") is
complex, with the distribution of functions varying according to local
arrangements. The upper-tier [subdivisions of
England](subdivisions_of_England "wikilink") are the nine
[regions](Regions_of_England "wikilink"), now used primarily for
statistical purposes.[^193] One of the regions, [Greater
London](Greater_London_Authority "wikilink"), has had a directly elected
assembly and mayor since 2000 following popular support for the proposal
in a [1998
referendum](1998_Greater_London_Authority_referendum "wikilink").[^194]

[Local government in Scotland](Local_government_in_Scotland "wikilink")
is divided into [32 council areas](subdivisions_of_Scotland "wikilink")
with a wide variation in size and population. The cities of
[Glasgow](Glasgow "wikilink"), Edinburgh,
[Aberdeen](Aberdeen "wikilink") and [Dundee](Dundee "wikilink") are
separate council areas, as is the [Highland
Council](Politics_of_the_Highland_council_area "wikilink"), which
includes a third of Scotland\'s area but only just over 200,000 people.
Local councils are made up of elected councillors, of whom there are
1,223.[^195]

[Local government in Wales](Local_government_in_Wales "wikilink")
consists of 22 unitary authorities, each led by a leader and cabinet
elected by the council itself. These include the cities of Cardiff,
Swansea and Newport, which are unitary authorities in their own
right.[^196] Elections are held every four years under the
first-past-the-post system.[^197]

[Local government in Northern
Ireland](Local_government_in_Northern_Ireland "wikilink") since 1973,
has been organised into 26 district councils, each elected by single
transferable vote. Their powers are limited to services such as waste
collection, dog control, and maintaining parks and cemeteries.[^198] In
2008 the executive agreed on proposals to create 11 new councils and
replace the present system.[^199]

#### Scotland

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Scottish Parliament|Scottish Government|Local government in Scotland}}
```
Since 1999, Scotland has had a devolved national
[government](Scottish_Government "wikilink") and [legislature called the
Scottish Parliament](Scottish_Parliament "wikilink"). The [Scottish
Government](Scottish_Government "wikilink") and
[Parliament](Scottish_Parliament "wikilink") have wide-ranging powers
over any matter that has not been specifically
[reserved](Reserved_and_excepted_matters "wikilink") to the UK
Parliament, including [education](education_in_Scotland "wikilink"),
[healthcare](NHS_Scotland "wikilink"), [Scots law](Scots_law "wikilink")
and [local government](Local_government_in_Scotland "wikilink").[^200]
Their power over economic issues is significantly constrained by an [act
of the UK
parliament](United_Kingdom_Internal_Market_Act_2020 "wikilink") passed
in
2020.`{{refn|name=UKIM|<ref name="Keating21">{{Cite journal |last=Keating |first=Michael |date=2 February 2021 |title=Taking back control?

The current [Scottish Government](Scottish_Government "wikilink") is a
[Scottish National Party](Scottish_National_Party "wikilink") and
[Scottish Greens](Scottish_Greens "wikilink")
[coalition](Coalition_government "wikilink"), led by [First
Minister](First_Minister_of_Scotland "wikilink") [Humza
Yousaf](Humza_Yousaf "wikilink"), leader of the Scottish National Party.
In 2014, the [Scottish independence
referendum](2014_Scottish_independence_referendum "wikilink") was held,
with 55.3% voting against independence from the United Kingdom and 44.7%
voting in favour, resulting in Scotland staying within the United
Kingdom. [Local government in
Scotland](Local_government_in_Scotland "wikilink") is divided into [32
council areas](subdivisions_of_Scotland "wikilink") with a wide
variation in size and population. Local councils are made up of elected
councillors, of whom there are 1,223.[^201]

#### Wales

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Senedd|Welsh Government|Local government in Wales}}
```
Since 1999, Wales has a devolved national
[government](Welsh_Government "wikilink") and legislature, known as the
[Senedd](Senedd "wikilink"). Elections to the Senedd use the [additional
member system](additional_member_system "wikilink"). They have more
limited powers than those devolved to Scotland.[^202] The Senedd is able
to legislate on any matter not specifically reserved to the UK
Parliament through [Acts of Senedd
Cymru](Acts_of_Senedd_Cymru "wikilink"). The current [Welsh
Government](Welsh_Government "wikilink") is
[Labour](Welsh_Labour "wikilink"), led by [First
Minister](First_Minister_of_Wales "wikilink") [Mark
Drakeford](Mark_Drakeford "wikilink"), who has been the First Minister
since 2018. [Local government in
Wales](Local_government_in_Wales "wikilink") consists of 22 unitary
authorities, each led by a leader and cabinet elected by the council
itself.

#### Northern Ireland {#northern_ireland}

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Northern Ireland Assembly|Northern Ireland Executive|Local government in Northern Ireland|The Troubles}}
```
Since 1998, Northern Ireland has a devolved government, the
[Executive](Northern_Ireland_Executive "wikilink"), and legislature, the
[Assembly](Northern_Ireland_Assembly "wikilink"). Elections to the
Assembly use the [single transferable
vote](single_transferable_vote "wikilink") system. The Executive and
Assembly have powers similar to those devolved to Scotland. The
Executive is led by a [diarchy](diarchy "wikilink") representing
[unionist](Designated_Unionist "wikilink") and
[nationalist](Designated_Nationalist "wikilink") members of the
Assembly.[^203] The [Island of Ireland](Ireland "wikilink") has a
turbulent and violent modern political history, a period referred to as
[the Troubles](the_Troubles "wikilink"). The 1998 [Good Friday
Agreement](Good_Friday_Agreement "wikilink") acts as a *de facto*
[constitution](constitution "wikilink") for Northern Ireland. [Local
government in Northern
Ireland](Local_government_in_Northern_Ireland "wikilink") since 2015 has
been divided between 11 councils with limited responsibilities.[^204]
The [First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern
Ireland](First_Minister_and_deputy_First_Minister_of_Northern_Ireland "wikilink")
are the joint heads of government of Northern Ireland.[^205][^206]

#### Constitutional arrangement {#constitutional_arrangement}

The UK does not have a [codified
constitution](codified_constitution "wikilink") and constitutional
matters are not among the powers devolved to Scotland, Wales or Northern
Ireland. Under the doctrine of [parliamentary
sovereignty](Parliamentary_sovereignty_in_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink"),
the UK Parliament could, in theory, therefore, abolish the Scottish
Parliament, Senedd or Northern Ireland Assembly.[^207] In practice, it
would be politically difficult for the UK Parliament to abolish
devolution to the Scottish Parliament and the Senedd, because these
institutions were created by referendum decisions.[^208] The political
constraints placed upon the UK Parliament\'s power to interfere with
devolution in Northern Ireland are greater still, because devolution in
Northern Ireland rests upon an international agreement with the
[Government of Ireland](Government_of_Ireland "wikilink").[^209] The UK
Parliament restricts the three devolved parliaments\' legislative
competence in economic areas through an act passed in 2020.[^210]

[OSCE](Organization_for_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe "wikilink").[^211]
The UK has the [British Council](British_Council "wikilink") which is a
British organisation based in over 100 countries specialising in
international cultural and educational opportunities. The UK is said to
have a \"[Special Relationship](Special_Relationship "wikilink")\" with
the United States and a close partnership with France -- the \"[Entente
cordiale](Entente_cordiale "wikilink")\" -- and shares nuclear weapons
technology with both countries;[^212][^213] the [Anglo-Portuguese
Alliance](Anglo-Portuguese_Alliance "wikilink") is considered to be the
oldest binding military alliance in the world. The UK is also closely
linked with the Republic of Ireland; the two countries share a [Common
Travel Area](Common_Travel_Area "wikilink") and co-operate through the
[British-Irish Intergovernmental
Conference](British-Irish_Intergovernmental_Conference "wikilink") and
the [British-Irish Council](British-Irish_Council "wikilink").
Britain\'s global presence and influence is further amplified through
its trading relations, foreign investments, [official development
assistance](official_development_assistance "wikilink") and military
engagements.[^214] Canada, Australia and New Zealand, all of which are
former colonies of the British Empire which share King Charles as their
head of state, are the most favourably viewed countries in the world by
[British people](British_people "wikilink").[^215]

The United Kingdom, the 14 British Overseas Territories[^216] and the
three Crown Dependencies[^217] form \'one undivided Realm\'.[^218][^219]
All parts of the realm are under the sovereignty of the [British
Crown](The_Crown "wikilink"), but the Territories and Dependencies are
not part of the UK. This is distinct from the status of [Commonwealth
realms](Commonwealth_realm "wikilink"), who have separate monarchies,
but share the same monarch.[^220]

of [Cyprus](Cyprus "wikilink").[^221] British claims in Antarctica have
limited international recognition.[^222] Collectively Britain\'s
overseas territories encompass an approximate land area of
`{{Convert|480000|sqnmi|sqmi km2}}`{=mediawiki},[^223] with a total
population of approximately 250,000.[^224] The overseas territories also
give the UK the world\'s fifth-largest [exclusive economic
zone](Exclusive_economic_zone_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") at
`{{Cvt|6,805,586|km2}}`{=mediawiki}.[^225]

The Crown Dependencies are possessions of [the
Crown](the_Crown "wikilink"), as opposed to territories of the UK.[^226]
They comprise three independently administered jurisdictions: the
Bailiwicks of [Jersey](Jersey "wikilink") and of
[Guernsey](Bailiwick_of_Guernsey "wikilink") in the English Channel, and
the [Isle of Man](Isle_of_Man "wikilink") in the Irish Sea. By mutual
agreement, the British Government manages the islands\' foreign affairs
and defence and the UK Parliament has the authority to legislate on
their behalf. Internationally, they are regarded as \"territories for
which the United Kingdom is responsible\".[^227] The power to pass
legislation affecting the islands ultimately rests with their own
respective legislative assemblies, with the assent of the Crown ([Privy
Council](Her_Majesty's_Most_Honourable_Privy_Council "wikilink") or, in
the case of the Isle of Man, in certain circumstances the
Lieutenant-Governor).[^228] Since 2005, each Crown dependency has had a
[Chief
Minister](List_of_current_heads_of_government_in_the_United_Kingdom_and_dependencies#Crown_Dependencies "wikilink")
as its [head of government](head_of_government "wikilink").[^229]

On 15 May 2023, the [sixteen heraldic
shields](Historical_flags_of_the_British_Empire_and_the_overseas_territories "wikilink")
of the British Overseas Territories and [the three coat of
arms](List_of_national_symbols_of_the_United_Kingdom,_the_Channel_Islands_and_the_Isle_of_Man "wikilink")
of the Crown Dependencies were \"immortalised\". in two new [stained

![The [Supreme Court](Supreme_Court_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") is
the final court of appeal for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and civil
cases in
Scotland.](Middlesex_Guildhall_(cropped).jpg "The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal for England, Wales, Northern Ireland and civil cases in Scotland.")
The United Kingdom does not have a single legal system as Article 19 of
the [1706 Treaty of Union](Treaty_of_Union "wikilink") provided for the
continuation of Scotland\'s separate legal system.[^231] Today the UK
has three distinct [systems of
law](Legal_systems_of_the_world "wikilink"): [English
law](English_law "wikilink"), [Northern Ireland
law](Courts_of_Northern_Ireland "wikilink") and [Scots
law](Scots_law "wikilink"). A new [Supreme Court of the United
Kingdom](Supreme_Court_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") came into being
in October 2009 to replace the [Appellate Committee of the House of
Lords](judicial_functions_of_the_House_of_Lords "wikilink").[^232] The
[Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council](Judicial_Committee_of_the_Privy_Council "wikilink"), including
the same members as the Supreme Court, is the highest court of appeal
for several independent Commonwealth countries, the [British Overseas
Territories](British_Overseas_Territories "wikilink") and the [Crown
Dependencies](Crown_Dependencies "wikilink").[^233]

Both English law, which applies in England and Wales, and [Northern
Ireland law](Northern_Ireland_law "wikilink") are based on
[common-law](Common_law "wikilink") principles.[^234] The [courts of
England and Wales](courts_of_England_and_Wales "wikilink") are headed by
the [Senior Courts of England and
Wales](Senior_Courts_of_England_and_Wales "wikilink"), consisting of the
[Court of Appeal](Court_of_Appeal_of_England_and_Wales "wikilink"), the
[High Court of Justice](High_Court_of_Justice "wikilink") (for civil
cases) and the [Crown Court](Crown_Court "wikilink") (for criminal
cases).[^235] Scots law is a hybrid system based on common-law and
[civil-law](Civil_law_(legal_system) "wikilink") principles. The chief
courts are the [Court of Session](Court_of_Session "wikilink"), for
civil cases,[^236] and the [High Court of
Justiciary](High_Court_of_Justiciary "wikilink"), for criminal
cases.[^237] The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom serves as the
highest court of appeal for civil cases under Scots law.[^238]

Crime in England and Wales increased in the period between 1981 and
1995, though since that peak there has been an overall fall of 66 per
cent in recorded crime from 1995 to 2015,[^239] according to [crime
statistics](Crime_statistics_in_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink"). As of
June 2023, the United Kingdom has the highest per-capita incarceration
rate in Western Europe.[^240][^241][^242]

[UK labour laws](United_Kingdom_labour_law "wikilink") entitle staff to
have a minimum set of employment rights including a [minimum
wage](National_Minimum_Wage_Act_1998 "wikilink"), a minimum of 28 days
annual holiday, statutory sick pay and a
[pension](Pensions_Act_2008 "wikilink"). [Same-sex
marriage](Same-sex_marriage "wikilink") has been legal in England,
Scotland, and Wales since 2014, and in [Northern
Ireland](Northern_Ireland "wikilink") since 2020.[^243] [LGBT
equality](LGBT_rights_in_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") in the United
Kingdom is considered advanced by modern standards.[^244][^245]

In 2023, the UK had 9 nuclear reactors normally generating about 15 per
cent of the UK\'s electricity.[^320] Unlike Germany and Japan, there are
two reactors under construction and more planned.[^321][^322] In the
late 1990s, nuclear power plants contributed around 25 per cent of the
total annual electricity generation in the UK, but this has gradually
declined as old plants have been shut down. The UK government is
investing in [Small Modular Reactors](Small_Modular_Reactors "wikilink")
and [Advanced Modular
Reactors](Nuclear_reactor#Future_and_developing_technologies "wikilink")
research and development.

In 2021, the UK produced 935 thousand [barrels](Oil_barrel "wikilink")
per day (bbl/d) of oil (and other liquids) and consumed 1,258 thousand
bbl/d.[^323] Production is now in decline and the UK has been a net
importer of oil since 2005.[^324]
`{{As of|2020|alt=In 2020}}`{=mediawiki}, the UK had around 2 billion
barrels of proven [crude oil reserves](North_Sea_oil "wikilink").[^325]

In 2021, the UK was the 21st-largest producer of [natural
gas](natural_gas "wikilink") in the world.[^326] Production is now in
decline and the UK has been a net importer of natural gas since
2004.[^327] In 2020, the UK produced 1.8 million tonnes of coal falling
91% in 10 years.[^328] In 2020 it had proven recoverable coal reserves
of 26 million tonnes.[^329] The UK [Coal
Authority](Coal_Authority "wikilink") has stated that there is a
potential to produce between 7 billion tonnes and 16 billion tonnes of
coal through [underground coal
gasification](underground_coal_gasification "wikilink") (UCG) or
\'[fracking](Hydraulic_fracturing "wikilink")\',[^330] and based on
current UK coal consumption, such reserves could last between 200 and
400 years.[^331]

### Water supply and sanitation {#water_supply_and_sanitation}

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in the United Kingdom}}
```
Access to improved water supply and sanitation in the UK is universal.
It is estimated that 96 per cent of households are connected to the
sewer network.[^332] According to the Environment Agency, total water
abstraction for public water supply in the UK was 16,406
[megalitres](megalitre "wikilink") per day in 2007.[^333]

In England and Wales water and sewerage services are provided by 10
private regional water and sewerage companies and 13 mostly smaller
private \"water only\" companies. In Scotland, water and sewerage
services are provided by a single public company, [Scottish
Water](Scottish_Water "wikilink"). In Northern Ireland water and
sewerage services are also provided by a single public entity, [Northern
Ireland Water](Northern_Ireland_Water "wikilink").[^334]

## Demographics

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Demography of the United Kingdom|British people|Ceremonial counties of England}}
```
In the [2011 census](United_Kingdom_Census_2011 "wikilink") the total
population of the United Kingdom was 63,181,775.[^335] It is the
[fourth-largest](List_of_European_countries_by_population "wikilink") in
Europe (after Russia, Germany and France), the fifth-largest in the
Commonwealth and the
[22nd-largest](List_of_countries_by_population "wikilink") in the world.
In mid-2014 and mid-2015 net long-term international migration
contributed more to population growth. In mid-2012 and mid-2013 natural
change contributed the most to population growth.[^336] Between 2001 and
2011 the population increased by an average annual rate of approximately
0.7 per cent.[^337] The 2011 census also showed that, over the previous
100 years, the proportion of the population aged 0--14 fell from 31 per
cent to 18 per cent, and the proportion of people aged 65 and over rose
from 5 to 16 per cent.[^338] In 2018 the [median
age](median_age "wikilink") of the UK population was 41.7 years.[^339]

England\'s population in 2011 was 53 million, representing some 84 per
cent of the UK total.[^340] It is one of the most densely populated
countries in the world, with 420 people per square kilometre in
mid-2015,[^341] with a particular concentration in London and the
south-east.[^342] The 2011 census put Scotland\'s population at
5.3 million,[^343] Wales at 3.06 million and Northern Ireland at
1.81 million.[^344]

In 2017 the average [total fertility
rate](total_fertility_rate "wikilink") (TFR) across the UK was 1.74
children born per woman.[^345] While a rising birth rate is contributing
to population growth, it remains considerably below the [baby
boom](baby_boom "wikilink") peak of 2.95 children per woman in
1964,[^346] or the high of 6.02 children born per woman in 1815,[^347]
below the replacement rate of 2.1, but higher than the 2001 record low
of 1.63.[^348] In 2011, 47.3 per cent of births in the UK were to
unmarried women.[^349] The [Office for National
Statistics](Office_for_National_Statistics "wikilink") reported in 2015
that out of the UK population aged 16 and over, 1.7 per cent identify as
gay, lesbian, or bisexual (2.0 per cent of males and 1.5 per cent of
females); 4.5 per cent of respondents responded with \"other\", \"I
don\'t know\", or did not respond.[^350] The number of
[transgender](transgender "wikilink") people in the UK was estimated to
be between 65,000 and 300,000 by research between 2001 and 2008.[^351]

### Ethnicity

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Ethnic groups in the United Kingdom}}
```
Historically, indigenous British people were thought to be [descended
from the various ethnic
groups](Genetic_history_of_the_British_Isles "wikilink") that settled
there before the 12th century: the [Celts](Celts "wikilink"), Romans,
Anglo-Saxons, Norse and the [Normans](Normans "wikilink"). [Welsh
people](Welsh_people "wikilink") could be the oldest ethnic group in the
UK.[^352] The UK has a history of non-white immigration with
[Liverpool](Liverpool "wikilink") having the oldest Black population in
the country dating back to at least the 1730s during the period of the
African slave trade. During this period it is estimated the
Afro-Caribbean population of Great Britain was 10,000 to 15,000[^353]
which later declined due to the abolition of slavery.[^354] The UK also
has the oldest [Chinese](British_Chinese "wikilink") community in
Europe, dating to the arrival of Chinese seamen in the 19th
century.[^355]
`{{As of|2011|alt=In [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011]]}}`{=mediawiki},
87.2 per cent of the UK population identified themselves as white,
meaning 12.8 per cent of the UK population identify themselves as of one
of an [ethnic minority](minority_group "wikilink") group.[^356]

most spoken language of the United Kingdom.[^361][^362] The United
Kingdom proactively promotes the language globally to build connections,
understanding and trust between people in the UK and countries
worldwide.[^363][^364] It is estimated that 95 per cent of the UK\'s
population are [monolingual](monolingual "wikilink") English
speakers.[^365] 5.5 per cent of the population are estimated to speak
languages brought to the UK as a result of relatively recent
immigration.[^366] South Asian languages are the largest grouping which
includes [Punjabi](Punjabi_language "wikilink"),
[Urdu](Urdu "wikilink"), [Bengali](Bengali_language "wikilink"),
[Sylheti](Sylheti_language "wikilink"), [Hindi](Hindi "wikilink") and
[Gujarati](Gujarati_language "wikilink").[^367] According to the 2011
census, [Polish](Polish_language "wikilink") has become the
second-largest language spoken in England and has 546,000
speakers.[^368] In 2019, some three-quarters of a million people spoke
little or no English.[^369] ![[Bilingual

[English](English_language "wikilink")) in [Newry](Newry "wikilink"),
[Northern
Ireland](Northern_Ireland "wikilink")](Bilingual_welcome_sign_Newry.jpg "Bilingual sign (Irish and English) in Newry, Northern Ireland")

Three indigenous [Celtic languages](Celtic_languages "wikilink") are
spoken in the UK: [Welsh](Welsh_language "wikilink"),
[Irish](Irish_language "wikilink") and [Scottish
Gaelic](Scottish_Gaelic "wikilink").
[Cornish](Cornish_language "wikilink"), which became extinct as a first
language in the late 18th century, is subject to revival efforts and has
a small group of second language speakers.[^370][^371] According to the
[2021 census](2021_United_Kingdom_census "wikilink"), the
[Welsh-speaking population](Welsh-speaking_population "wikilink") of
Wales aged three or older was 538,300 people (17.8 per cent).[^372] In
addition, it is estimated that about 200,000 Welsh speakers live in
England.[^373] In the 2021 census in Northern Ireland 12.4% of people
had some ability in the [Irish
language](Irish_language_in_Northern_Ireland "wikilink") and 10.4% of
people had some ability in the
[Ulster-Scots](Ulster_Scots_dialect "wikilink") language.[^374] Over
92,000 people in Scotland (just under 2 per cent of the population) had
some Gaelic language ability, including 72 per cent of those living in
the [Outer Hebrides](Outer_Hebrides "wikilink").[^375] The number of
children being taught either Welsh or Scottish Gaelic is
increasing.[^376] [Scots](Scots_language "wikilink"), a language
descended from early northern [Middle
English](Middle_English "wikilink"), has limited
[recognition](European_Charter_for_Regional_or_Minority_Languages "wikilink")
alongside its regional variant, [Ulster
Scots](Ulster_Scots_dialects "wikilink") in Northern Ireland, without
specific commitments to protection and promotion.[^377][^378] As of
April 2020, there are said to be around 151,000 users of [British Sign
Language](British_Sign_Language "wikilink") (BSL), a [sign
language](sign_language "wikilink") used by deaf people, in the
UK.[^379]

Forms of [Christianity](History_of_Christianity_in_Britain "wikilink")
have dominated religious life in what is now the United Kingdom for more
than 1,400 years.[^380] Although a majority of citizens still identify
with Christianity in many surveys, regular church attendance has fallen
dramatically since the middle of the 20th century,[^381] while
immigration and demographic change have contributed to the growth of
other faiths, most notably Islam.[^382] This has led some commentators
to variously describe the UK as a multi-faith,[^383]
[secularised](secularised "wikilink"),[^384] or
[post-Christian](post-Christian "wikilink") society.[^385]

In the 2001 census, 71.6 per cent of all respondents indicated that they
were Christians, with the next largest faiths being
[Islam](Islam "wikilink") (2.8 per cent),
[Hinduism](Hinduism "wikilink") (1.0 per cent),
[Sikhism](Sikhism "wikilink") (0.6 per cent),
[Judaism](Judaism "wikilink") (0.5 per cent),
[Buddhism](Buddhism "wikilink") (0.3 per cent) and all other religions
(0.3 per cent).[^386] Of the respondents, 15 per cent stated that they
had [no religion](irreligion "wikilink") and a further 7 per cent did
not state a religious preference.[^387] A
[Tearfund](Tearfund "wikilink") survey in 2007 showed that only one in
ten Britons actually attend church weekly.[^388] Between the 2001 and
2011 census, there was a 12 per cent decrease in the number of people
who identified as Christian, while the percentage of those reporting no
religious affiliation doubled. This contrasted with growth in the other
main religious group categories, with the number of Muslims increasing
by the most substantial margin to a total of about 5 per cent.[^389] The
[Muslim population](Islam_in_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") has
increased from 1.6 million in 2001 to 2.7 million in 2011, making it the
second-largest religious group in the UK.[^390]

The Church of England is the [established
church](State_religion "wikilink") in England.[^391] It retains a
[representation](Lords_Spiritual "wikilink") in the UK Parliament, and
the British monarch is its [Supreme
Governor](Supreme_Governor_of_the_Church_of_England "wikilink").[^392]
In [Scotland](religion_in_Scotland "wikilink"), the [Church of
Scotland](Church_of_Scotland "wikilink") is recognised as the [national
church](national_church "wikilink"). It is not subject to state control,
and the British monarch is an ordinary member, required to swear an oath
to \"maintain and preserve the Protestant Religion and [Presbyterian
Church Government](Presbyterian_polity "wikilink")\" upon his or her
accession.[^393][^394][^395] The [Church in
Wales](Church_in_Wales "wikilink") was disestablished in 1920 and,
because the [Church of Ireland](Church_of_Ireland "wikilink") was
disestablished in 1870 before the [partition of
Ireland](partition_of_Ireland "wikilink"), there is no established
church in Northern Ireland.[^396] Although there are no UK-wide data in
the 2001 census on adherence to individual Christian denominations, it
has been estimated that 62 per cent of Christians are Anglican, 13.5 per
cent Catholic, 6 per cent Presbyterian, and 3.4 per cent Methodist, with
small numbers of other Protestant denominations such as [Plymouth
Brethren](Plymouth_Brethren "wikilink"), and
[Orthodox](Eastern_Orthodox_Church "wikilink") churches.[^397]

### Migration

```{=mediawiki}
{{See also|Foreign-born population of the United Kingdom}}
```
[thumb\|upright=1.35\|Estimated foreign-born population by country of

[thumb\|upright=1.35\|Estimated number of British citizens living
overseas by country in
2006](File:British_expats_countrymap.svg "wikilink")

Immigration is now contributing to a rising UK population,[^398] with
arrivals and UK-born children of migrants accounting for about half of
the population increase between 1991 and 2001. According to official
statistics released in 2015, 27 per cent of UK live births in 2014 were
to mothers born outside the UK.[^399] The ONS reported that net
migration rose from 2009 to 2010 by 21 per cent to 239,000.[^400]

In 2013, approximately 208,000 foreign nationals were naturalised as
British citizens, the highest number since 1962. This figure fell to
around 125,800 in 2014. Between 2009 and 2013, the average number of
British citizenships granted annually was 195,800. The most common
previous nationalities of those naturalised in 2014 were Indian,
Pakistani, [Filipino](Philippines "wikilink"),
[Nigerian](Nigeria "wikilink"), [Bangladeshi](Bangladesh "wikilink"),
[Nepali](Nepal "wikilink"), Chinese, South African, Polish and
[Somali](Somalia "wikilink").[^401] The total number of grants of
settlement, which confer [permanent
residence](Permanent_residency "wikilink") in the UK but not
citizenship,[^402] was approximately 154,700 in 2013, higher than the
previous two years.[^403]

Emigration was an important feature of British society in the 19th
century. Between 1815 and 1930, around 11.4 million people emigrated
from Britain and 7.3 million from Ireland. Estimates show that by the
end of the 20th century, some 300 million people of British and Irish
descent were permanently settled around the globe.[^404] Today, at least
5.5 million UK-born people live abroad,[^405][^406] mainly in Australia,
Spain, the United States and Canada.[^407][^408]

### Education

![[University of Oxford](University_of_Oxford "wikilink") is widely
regarded as one of the world\'s leading universities.
](Oxford_-_Radcliffe_Square_-_University_Church_of_St_Mary_the_Virgin,_Brasenose_College,_Radcliffe_Camera_1737-48_by_James_Gibbs,_Bodleian_Library_&_All_Souls_College_04.jpg "University of Oxford is widely regarded as one of the world's leading universities. ")
Education in the United Kingdom is a [devolved](Devolution "wikilink")
matter, with each country having a separate education system. About 38
per cent of the United Kingdom population has a university or [college
degree](college_degree "wikilink"), which is the highest percentage in
Europe, and among the highest percentages in the world.[^409] The United
Kingdom is home to many universities, including the [University of
Oxford](University_of_Oxford "wikilink") and [University of
Cambridge](University_of_Cambridge "wikilink") which often achieve first
place on global rankings.[^410][^411]

University education has varied tuition fees between the different
regions of the UK. England and Wales have a fixed maximum annual fee for
all UK citizens. Northern Ireland and Scotland have a reduced maximum
fee or no fee for citizens where it is their home region. Some NHS
courses have bursaries which pay the fee and in 2017 it was stated that
each doctor gets subsidised by 230,000 during their
training.[^412][^413]

In 2022, the [Programme for International Student Assessment
(PISA)](Programme_for_International_Student_Assessment "wikilink"),
coordinated by the [OECD](OECD "wikilink"), ranked the overall knowledge
and skills of British 15-year-olds as 14th in the world in reading,
mathematics and science. The average British student scored 494, well
above the OECD average of 478.[^414][^415]

### Healthcare

```{=mediawiki}

```
![[NHS Scotland](NHS_Scotland "wikilink")\'s [Queen Elizabeth University
Hospital](Queen_Elizabeth_University_Hospital "wikilink") in Glasgow,
the largest hospital campus in
Europe](QEUH.jpg "NHS Scotland's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, the largest hospital campus in Europe")

The modern-system of [universal](Universal_service "wikilink") [publicly
funded](Publicly_funded_health_care "wikilink") in the United Kingdom
has its origins in the creation of the [National Health
Service](National_Health_Service "wikilink") (NHS) in 1949 which still
exists to this day and is the primary healthcare provider in the United
Kingdom. The widespread popularity of the NHS has led to it being
described as a \"national religion\".[^416][^417] Healthcare in the
United Kingdom is a [devolved matter](Devolution "wikilink") and each
country has its own system of universal publicly funded healthcare,
although private healthcare is also available. Public healthcare is
provided to all [UK permanent
residents](British_nationality_law "wikilink") and is mostly free at the
point of need, being paid for from [general
taxation](Taxation_in_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink"). The [World Health
Organization](World_Health_Organization "wikilink"), in 2000, ranked the
provision of healthcare in the United Kingdom as fifteenth best in
Europe and eighteenth in the world.[^418]

Since 1979, expenditure on healthcare has been increased
significantly.[^419] The 2018 [OECD](OECD "wikilink") data, which
incorporates in health a chunk of what in the UK is classified as social
care, has the UK spending 3,121 per head.[^420] In 2017 the UK spent
2,989 per person on healthcare, around the median for members of the
[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development](Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development "wikilink").[^421]

Regulatory bodies are organised on a UK-wide basis such as the [General
Medical Council](General_Medical_Council "wikilink"), the [Nursing and
Midwifery Council](Nursing_and_Midwifery_Council "wikilink") and
non-governmental-based, such as the [Royal
Colleges](Royal_College "wikilink"). Political and operational
responsibility for healthcare lies with four national
[executives](executive_(government) "wikilink"); [healthcare in
England](healthcare_in_England "wikilink") is the responsibility of the
UK Government; [healthcare in Northern
Ireland](healthcare_in_Northern_Ireland "wikilink") is the
responsibility of the [Northern Ireland
Executive](Northern_Ireland_Executive "wikilink"); [healthcare in
Scotland](healthcare_in_Scotland "wikilink") is the responsibility of
the [Scottish Government](Scottish_Government "wikilink"); and
[healthcare in Wales](healthcare_in_Wales "wikilink") is the
responsibility of the [Welsh Government](Welsh_Government "wikilink").
Each [National Health Service](National_Health_Service "wikilink") has
different policies and priorities, resulting in contrasts.[^422]

## Culture

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Culture of the United Kingdom}}
```
The culture of the United Kingdom is influenced by many factors
including: the nation\'s island status; [its
history](History_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink"); and being a
[political union](political_union "wikilink") of four countries with
each preserving elements of distinctive traditions, customs and
symbolism. As a result of the [British
Empire](British_Empire "wikilink"), British influence can be observed in
[the language](English_language "wikilink"), culture and [legal
systems](Common_law "wikilink") of many of [its former
colonies](List_of_countries_that_have_gained_independence_from_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink"),
in particular, the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and
Ireland, a common culture known today as the
[Anglosphere](Anglosphere "wikilink").[^423]`{{Sfn|Ferguson|2004|p=307}}`{=mediawiki}
The substantial cultural influence of the United Kingdom has led to it
being described as a \"[cultural
superpower](cultural_superpower "wikilink")\".[^424][^425] A global
opinion poll for the BBC saw the United Kingdom ranked the third most
positively viewed nation in the world (behind Germany and Canada) in
2013 and 2014.[^426]

### Literature

British literature includes literature associated with the United
Kingdom, the [Isle of Man](Isle_of_Man "wikilink") and the [Channel
Islands](Channel_Islands "wikilink"). Most British literature is in
English. In 2005, some 206,000 books were published in the United
Kingdom and in 2006 it was the [largest publisher of
books](books_published_per_country_per_year "wikilink") in the
world.[^427]

The English playwright and poet [William
Shakespeare](William_Shakespeare "wikilink") is widely regarded as the
greatest dramatist of all time.[^428] The 20th-century English crime
writer [Agatha Christie](Agatha_Christie "wikilink") is the
[best-selling novelist](List_of_best-selling_fiction_authors "wikilink")
of all time.[^429] Twelve of the top 25 of 100 novels by British writers
chosen by a BBC poll of global critics were written by women; these
included works by [George Eliot](George_Eliot "wikilink"), [Virginia
Woolf](Virginia_Woolf "wikilink"),
[Charlotte](Charlotte_Bront "wikilink") and [Emily
Bront](Emily_Bront "wikilink"), [Mary
Shelley](Mary_Shelley "wikilink"), [Jane
Austen](Jane_Austen "wikilink"), [Doris
Lessing](Doris_Lessing "wikilink") and [Zadie

[Arthur Conan Doyle](Arthur_Conan_Doyle "wikilink") (the creator of
[Sherlock Holmes](Sherlock_Holmes "wikilink")), [Sir Walter
Scott](Walter_Scott "wikilink"), [J. M.
Barrie](J._M._Barrie "wikilink"), [Robert Louis
Stevenson](Robert_Louis_Stevenson "wikilink") and the poet [Robert
Burns](Robert_Burns "wikilink"). More recently [Hugh
MacDiarmid](Hugh_MacDiarmid "wikilink") and [Neil M.
Gunn](Neil_M._Gunn "wikilink") contributed to the [Scottish
Renaissance](Scottish_Renaissance "wikilink"), with grimmer works from
[Ian Rankin](Ian_Rankin "wikilink") and [Iain
Banks](Iain_Banks "wikilink"). Scotland\'s capital, Edinburgh, was
UNESCO\'s first worldwide [City of
Literature](City_of_Literature "wikilink").[^431]

Welsh literature includes Britain\'s oldest known poem, *[Y
Gododdin](Y_Gododdin "wikilink")*, which was composed most likely in the
late 6th century. It was written in
[Cumbric](Cumbric_language "wikilink") or [Old
Welsh](Old_Welsh "wikilink") and contains the earliest known reference
to [King Arthur](King_Arthur "wikilink").[^432] The Arthurian legend was
further developed by [Geoffrey of
Monmouth](Geoffrey_of_Monmouth "wikilink").[^433] Poet [Dafydd ap
Gwilym](Dafydd_ap_Gwilym "wikilink") (*fl.* 1320--1370) is regarded as
one of the greatest European poets of his age.[^434] [Daniel
Owen](Daniel_Owen "wikilink") is credited as the first Welsh-language
novelist, publishing *[Rhys Lewis](Rhys_Lewis_(novel) "wikilink")* in
1885. The best-known of the [Anglo-Welsh
poets](Anglo-Welsh_poetry "wikilink") are [Dylan
Thomas](Dylan_Thomas "wikilink") and [R. S.
Thomas](R._S._Thomas "wikilink"), the latter nominated for the [Nobel
Prize in Literature](Nobel_Prize_in_Literature "wikilink") in 1996.
Leading Welsh novelists of the twentieth century include [Richard
Llewellyn](Richard_Llewellyn "wikilink") and [Kate
Roberts](Kate_Roberts_(author) "wikilink").[^435][^436]

Irish writers, living at a time when all of Ireland was part of the
United Kingdom, include [Oscar Wilde](Oscar_Wilde "wikilink"),[^437]
[Bram Stoker](Bram_Stoker "wikilink")[^438] and [George Bernard
Shaw](George_Bernard_Shaw "wikilink").[^439] There have been many
authors whose origins were from outside the United Kingdom but who moved
to the UK, including [Joseph Conrad](Joseph_Conrad "wikilink"),[^440]
[T. S. Eliot](T._S._Eliot "wikilink"),[^441] [Kazuo
Ishiguro](Kazuo_Ishiguro "wikilink"),[^442] Sir [Salman
Rushdie](Salman_Rushdie "wikilink")[^443] and [Ezra
Pound](Ezra_Pound "wikilink").[^444]

### Philosophy

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|British philosophy}}
```
The United Kingdom is famous for the tradition of \'[British
Empiricism](British_Empiricism "wikilink")\', a branch of the philosophy
of knowledge that states that only knowledge verified by experience is
valid, and \'Scottish Philosophy\', sometimes referred to as the
\'[Scottish School of Common
Sense](Scottish_School_of_Common_Sense "wikilink")\'.[^445] The most
famous philosophers of British Empiricism are [John
Locke](John_Locke "wikilink"), [George
Berkeley](George_Berkeley "wikilink")`{{Efn|Berkeley is in fact Irish but was called a 'British empiricist' due to the territory of what is now known as the [[Republic of Ireland]] being in the UK at the time.}}`{=mediawiki}
and [David Hume](David_Hume "wikilink"); while [Dugald
Stewart](Dugald_Stewart "wikilink"), [Thomas
Reid](Thomas_Reid "wikilink") and [William
Hamilton](Sir_William_Hamilton,_9th_Baronet "wikilink") were major
exponents of the Scottish \"common sense\" school. Two Britons are also
notable for the ethical theory of
[utilitarianism](utilitarianism "wikilink"), a moral philosophy first
used by [Jeremy Bentham](Jeremy_Bentham "wikilink") and later by [John
Stuart Mill](John_Stuart_Mill "wikilink") in his short work
*[Utilitarianism](Utilitarianism_(book) "wikilink")*.[^446]

### Music

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Music of the United Kingdom}}
```
![[The Proms](The_Proms "wikilink") is a classical music festival, most
closely associated with [Henry Wood](Henry_Wood "wikilink") and held at
the [Royal Albert Hall](Royal_Albert_Hall "wikilink"), which regularly
plays music by [Edward Elgar](Edward_Elgar "wikilink") and other British
composers.](Royal_Albert_Hall,_BBC_Proms_2017.jpg "The Proms is a classical music festival, most closely associated with Henry Wood and held at the Royal Albert Hall, which regularly plays music by Edward Elgar and other British composers.")
Various styles of music have become popular in the UK, including the
indigenous [folk music](folk_music "wikilink") of
[England](Folk_music_of_England "wikilink"),
[Wales](Music_of_Wales#Folk_music "wikilink"),
[Scotland](Folk_music_of_Scotland "wikilink") and [Northern
Ireland](Folk_music_of_Northern_Ireland "wikilink"). Historically, there
has been exceptional Renaissance music from the [Tudor
period](Tudor_period "wikilink"), with masses, madrigals and lute music
by [Thomas Tallis](Thomas_Tallis "wikilink"), [John
Taverner](John_Taverner "wikilink"), [William
Byrd](William_Byrd "wikilink"), [Orlando
Gibbons](Orlando_Gibbons "wikilink") and [John
Dowland](John_Dowland "wikilink"). After the [Stuart
Restoration](Stuart_Restoration "wikilink"), an English tradition of
dramatic masques, anthems and airs became established, led by [Henry
Purcell](Henry_Purcell "wikilink"), followed by [Thomas
Arne](Thomas_Arne "wikilink") and others. The German-born composer
[George Frideric Handel](George_Frideric_Handel "wikilink") became a
[naturalised](Naturalization "wikilink") [British
citizen](British_nationality_law "wikilink") in 1727, when he composed
the anthem *[Zadok the Priest](Zadok_the_Priest "wikilink")* for the
[coronation of George II](coronation_of_George_II "wikilink"); it became
the traditional ceremonial music for anointing all future monarchs.
Handel\'s many oratorios, such as his famous
*[Messiah](Messiah_(Handel) "wikilink")*, were written in the English
language.[^447] In the second half of the 19th century, as [Arthur
Sullivan](Arthur_Sullivan "wikilink") and his librettist [W. S.
Gilbert](W._S._Gilbert "wikilink") wrote their popular [Savoy
operas](Savoy_opera "wikilink"), [Edward
Elgar](Edward_Elgar "wikilink")\'s wide range of music rivalled that of
his contemporaries on the continent. Increasingly, however, composers
became inspired by the English countryside and its [folk
music](folk_music "wikilink"), notably [Gustav
Holst](Gustav_Holst "wikilink"), [Ralph Vaughan
Williams](Ralph_Vaughan_Williams "wikilink"), and [Benjamin
Britten](Benjamin_Britten "wikilink"), a pioneer of modern British
opera. Among the many post-war composers, some of the most notable have
made their own personal choice of musical identity: [Peter Maxwell
Davies](Peter_Maxwell_Davies "wikilink") (Orkney), [Harrison
Birtwistle](Harrison_Birtwistle "wikilink") (mythological), and [John
Tavener](John_Tavener "wikilink") (religious).[^448] Today, recent
classical singers include: [Alfie Boe](Alfie_Boe "wikilink"), [Bryn
Terfel](Bryn_Terfel "wikilink"), [Katherine
Jenkins](Katherine_Jenkins "wikilink"), [Michael
Ball](Michael_Ball "wikilink"), [Roderick
Williams](Roderick_Williams "wikilink"), [Russell
Watson](Russell_Watson "wikilink") and [Sarah
Brightman](Sarah_Brightman "wikilink"), while [Nicola
Benedetti](Nicola_Benedetti "wikilink") and [Nigel
Kennedy](Nigel_Kennedy "wikilink") are renowned for their violin
ability.[^449]

According to *[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and
Musicians](The_New_Grove_Dictionary_of_Music_and_Musicians "wikilink")*,
the term \"[pop music](pop_music "wikilink")\" originated in Britain in
the mid-1950s to describe [rock and roll](rock_and_roll "wikilink")\'s
fusion with the \"new youth music\".[^450] *The Oxford Dictionary of
Music* states that artists such as [the Beatles](the_Beatles "wikilink")
and [the Rolling Stones](the_Rolling_Stones "wikilink") drove pop music
to the forefront of popular music in the early 1960s.[^451] Birmingham
became known as the birthplace of [heavy
metal](heavy_metal_music "wikilink"), with the band [Black
Sabbath](Black_Sabbath "wikilink") starting there in the 1960s.[^452] In
the following years, Britain widely occupied a part in the development
of [rock music](rock_music "wikilink"), with British acts pioneering
[hard rock](hard_rock "wikilink");[^453] [raga

dish served with lemon, tartar sauce and mushy
peas](Fish,_chips_and_mushy_peas.jpg "Fish and chips, a traditional British dish served with lemon, tartar sauce and mushy peas")

British cuisine developed from various influences reflective of its
land, settlements, arrivals of new settlers and immigrants, trade and
colonialism. The [British Empire](British_Empire "wikilink") facilitated
a knowledge of [Indian cuisine](Indian_cuisine "wikilink") with its
\"strong, penetrating spices and herbs\". British cuisine has absorbed
the cultural influence of those who have [settled in
Britain](Immigration_to_the_United_Kingdom_since_1922 "wikilink"),
producing hybrid dishes, such as [chicken tikka
masala](chicken_tikka_masala "wikilink").[^494] The British have
embraced world cuisine and regularly eat recipes or fast food from
Europe, the Caribbean and Asia. Afternoon tea is a light afternoon meal
served with tea in tea rooms and hotels around the United Kingdom, with
the tradition dating back to around 1840.[^495]

A 2019 YouGov poll rated classic British food, the following had more
than 80% of people like them who had tried them: Sunday roast, Yorkshire
pudding, Fish and chips, Crumpets, and Full English breakfast.[^496]
Sweet foods are common within British cuisine, and there is a long list
of [British desserts](List_of_British_desserts "wikilink").

[Vegan](Veganism "wikilink") and
[vegetarian](Vegetarianism_in_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink") diets have
increased in Britain in recent years. In 2021, a survey found that 8% of
British respondents eat a plant-based diet and 36% of respondents have a
favourable view of plant-based diets.[^497]

The [flag of the United Kingdom](flag_of_the_United_Kingdom "wikilink")
is the [Union Flag](Union_Flag "wikilink") (also referred to as the
Union Jack).[^523] It was created in 1606 by the superimposition of the
[flag of England](flag_of_England "wikilink"), representing [Saint
George](Saint_George "wikilink"), on the [flag of
Scotland](flag_of_Scotland "wikilink"), representing [Saint
Andrew](Saint_Andrew "wikilink"), and was updated in 1801 with the
addition of [Saint Patrick\'s
Flag](Saint_Patrick's_Flag "wikilink").[^524] Wales is not represented
in the Union Flag, as Wales had been conquered and annexed to England
prior to the formation of the United Kingdom. The possibility of
redesigning the Union Flag to include representation of Wales has not
been completely ruled out.[^525] The [national
anthem](national_anthem "wikilink") of the United Kingdom is \"[God Save
the King](God_Save_the_King "wikilink")\", with \"King\" replaced with
\"Queen\" in the lyrics whenever the monarch is a woman.

[Britannia](Britannia "wikilink") is a [national
personification](national_personification "wikilink") of the United
Kingdom, originating from [Roman
Britain](Roman_Britain "wikilink").[^526] Beside [The Lion and the
Unicorn](The_Lion_and_the_Unicorn "wikilink") and the
[dragon](Welsh_Dragon "wikilink") of heraldry, the
[bulldog](bulldog "wikilink") is an iconic animal and commonly
represented with the Union Flag.[^527] A now rare personification is a
character originating in the 18th century, [John
Bull](John_Bull "wikilink").[^528]

[England](National_symbols_of_England "wikilink"),
[Wales](National_symbols_of_Wales "wikilink"), and
[Scotland](National_symbols_of_Scotland "wikilink") each have a number
of their own national symbols, including their national flags. [Northern
Ireland](National_symbols_of_Ireland,_the_Republic_of_Ireland_and_Northern_Ireland "wikilink")
also has a number of symbols, many of which are shared with [Republic of
Ireland](Republic_of_Ireland "wikilink").

**Turkey**, officially the **Republic of Trkiye**
(`{{lang-tr|Trkiye Cumhuriyeti}}`{=mediawiki}
`{{IPA-tr|tycije dumhuijeti||Tur-Trkiye_Cumhuriyeti.ogg}}`{=mediawiki}),
is a country mainly in [Anatolia](Anatolia "wikilink") in [West
Asia](West_Asia "wikilink"), with a smaller part called [East
Thrace](East_Thrace "wikilink") in [Southeast
Europe](Southeast_Europe "wikilink"). It borders the [Black
Sea](Black_Sea "wikilink") to the north;
[Georgia](Georgia_(country) "wikilink"), [Armenia](Armenia "wikilink"),
[Azerbaijan](Azerbaijan "wikilink"), and [Iran](Iran "wikilink") to the
east; [Iraq](Iraq "wikilink"), [Syria](Syria "wikilink"), and the
[Mediterranean Sea](Mediterranean_Sea "wikilink") (and
[Cyprus](Cyprus "wikilink")) to the south; and the [Aegean
Sea](Aegean_Sea "wikilink"), [Greece](Greece "wikilink"), and
[Bulgaria](Bulgaria "wikilink") to the west. Turkey is home to over 85
million people; most are ethnic [Turks](Turkish_people "wikilink"),
while ethnic [Kurds](Kurds "wikilink") are the [largest ethnic
minority](Minorities_in_Turkey "wikilink").[^1] Officially a [secular
state](Secularism_in_Turkey "wikilink"), Turkey has a
[Muslim-majority](Islam_in_Turkey "wikilink") population.
[Ankara](Ankara "wikilink") is Turkey\'s capital and [second-largest
city](List_of_largest_cities_and_towns_in_Turkey "wikilink");
[Istanbul](Istanbul "wikilink") is its largest city, and its
[economic](Economy_of_Istanbul "wikilink") and [financial
center](Financial_centre "wikilink"), as well as the [largest city in
Europe](List_of_European_cities_by_population_within_city_limits "wikilink").
Other major cities include [zmir](zmir "wikilink"),
[Bursa](Bursa "wikilink"), [Antalya](Antalya "wikilink"),
[Konya](Konya "wikilink") and [Adana](Adana "wikilink").

[Human](Human "wikilink") habitation began in [Late
Paleolithic](Late_Paleolithic "wikilink").[^2] Home to important
[Neolithic](Prehistory_of_Anatolia "wikilink") sites like [Gbekli
Tepe](Gbekli_Tepe "wikilink") and some of the [earliest farming
areas](Neolithic_Revolution "wikilink"), present-day Turkey was
inhabited by [various ancient
peoples](List_of_ancient_peoples_of_Anatolia "wikilink").[^3][^4][^5][^6]
[Hattians](Hattians "wikilink") were assimilated by the incoming
[Anatolian peoples](Anatolian_peoples "wikilink").[^7][^8] Increasing
diversity during [Classical Anatolia](Classical_Anatolia "wikilink")
transitioned into cultural [Hellenization](Hellenization "wikilink")
following the conquests of [Alexander the
Great](Alexander_the_Great "wikilink");[^9][^10] Hellenization continued
during the [Roman](Roman_Empire "wikilink") and
[Byzantine](Byzantine_Empire "wikilink") eras.[^11][^12] The [Seljuk
Turks](Seljuk_Empire "wikilink") began migrating into Anatolia in the
11th century, starting the [Turkification](Turkification "wikilink")
process.[^13][^14] The Seljuk [Sultanate of
Rum](Sultanate_of_Rum "wikilink") ruled Anatolia until the [Mongol
invasion](Mongol_invasions_of_Anatolia "wikilink") in 1243, when it
disintegrated into [Turkish
principalities](Anatolian_beyliks "wikilink").[^15] Beginning in 1299,
the [Ottomans](Ottoman_Empire "wikilink") united the principalities and
[expanded](Rise_of_the_Ottoman_Empire "wikilink"); [Mehmed
II](Mehmed_II "wikilink") conquered [Istanbul in
1453](Fall_of_Constantinople "wikilink"). During the reigns of [Selim
I](Selim_I "wikilink") and [Suleiman the
Magnificent](Suleiman_the_Magnificent "wikilink"), the Ottoman Empire
became a [global
power](Transformation_of_the_Ottoman_Empire "wikilink").[^16][^17][^18]

From the late 18th century onwards, the [empire\'s power and territory
declined](Decline_and_modernization_of_the_Ottoman_Empire "wikilink");[^19]
[reforms](Tanzimat "wikilink") were also made.[^20] In the 19th and
early 20th centuries, [persecution of Muslims during the Ottoman
contraction](persecution_of_Muslims_during_the_Ottoman_contraction "wikilink")
and [in the Russian
Empire](Persecution_of_Muslims#Russian_Empire "wikilink") resulted in
large-scale loss of life and [mass migration](muhacir "wikilink") into
modern-day Turkey from the [Balkans](Balkans "wikilink"),
[Caucasus](Caucasus "wikilink"), and
[Crimea](Crimean_Khanate "wikilink").[^21] The circular also stated that
in relation to other governmental communications, the \"necessary
sensitivity will be shown on the use of the phrase \'Trkiye\' instead
of phrases such as \'Turkey\' (in English)\".[^22][^23] The reason given
was that *Trkiye* \"represents and expresses the culture, civilization,
and values of the Turkish nation in the best way\".[^24] In May 2022,
the Turkish government requested the [United
Nations](United_Nations "wikilink") and other international
organizations to use *Trkiye* officially in English, which the UN
immediately agreed to do.[^25][^26][^27]

![Some [henges](henge "wikilink") at [Gbekli
Tepe](Gbekli_Tepe "wikilink") were erected as far back as [9600
BC](Gbekli_Tepe#Large_enclosures "wikilink"), predating those of
[Stonehenge](Stonehenge "wikilink") by over seven
millennia.[^28]](Gbekli_Tepe,_Urfa.jpg "Some henges at Gbekli Tepe were erected as far back as 9600 BC, predating those of Stonehenge by over seven millennia.")
The [Anatolian peninsula](Anatolia "wikilink"), comprising most of
modern Turkey, has been inhabited by [modern humans](Human "wikilink")
since the [late Paleolithic](Upper_Paleolithic "wikilink") period.[^30]
The European part of Turkey, called [Eastern
Thrace](East_Thrace "wikilink"), has been inhabited since at least
40,000 years ago and is known to have been in the Neolithic era by about
6000 BC.[^31] The [spread of
agriculture](Neolithic_Revolution "wikilink") from the [Middle
East](Middle_East "wikilink") to Europe was strongly correlated with the
[migration](Pre-modern_human_migration "wikilink") of [early farmers
from Anatolia](Early_European_Farmers "wikilink") about 9,000 years ago
and was not just a cultural exchange.[^32] Anatolian Neolithic farmers
derived a significant portion of their ancestry from the [Anatolian
hunter-gatherers](Anatolian_hunter-gatherers "wikilink").[^33]

}}`{=mediawiki} Present-day Turkey contains some of the world\'s oldest
Neolithic sites.[^34] [Gbekli Tepe](Gbekli_Tepe "wikilink") is the
site of the oldest known man-made structure in the world, a temple
dating to `{{circa|9600 BC}}`{=mediawiki},[^35] while
[atalhyk](atalhyk "wikilink") is a very large Neolithic and
[Chalcolithic](Chalcolithic "wikilink") settlement in Anatolia, which
existed `{{circa|7500|5700 BC}}`{=mediawiki}. It is the largest and
best-preserved Neolithic site found to date.[^36] The [Urfa
Man](Urfa_Man "wikilink") statue is dated
`{{circa|9000 BC}}`{=mediawiki}, to the period of the [Pre-Pottery
Neolithic](Pre-Pottery_Neolithic "wikilink"), and is defined as \"the
oldest known naturalistic life-sized sculpture of a human\".[^37]
[Troy](Troy "wikilink") was first settled in the Neolithic Age, with
habitation continuing into the Byzantine period. [Troy\'s Late Bronze
Age layers](Late_Bronze_Age_Troy "wikilink") are considered potential
historical settings for the later legends of the [Trojan
War](Trojan_War "wikilink").[^38][^39][^40]

The earliest recorded inhabitants of Anatolia were the
[Hattians](Hattians "wikilink") and [Hurrians](Hurrians "wikilink"),
non-Indo-European peoples who lived in Anatolia as early as
`{{circa|2300 BC}}`{=mediawiki}. Indo-European
[Hittites](Hittites "wikilink") came to Anatolia and gradually absorbed
the Hattians and Hurrians `{{circa|2000|1700 BC}}`{=mediawiki}. Various
other ancient [Anatolian populations](Anatolian_peoples "wikilink") have
also lived in Anatolia, from at least the
[Neolithic](Neolithic "wikilink") until the [Hellenistic
period](Hellenistic_period "wikilink").[^41] Many of these peoples spoke
the [Anatolian languages](Anatolian_languages "wikilink"), a branch of
the larger [Indo-European language
family](Indo-European_language_family "wikilink").[^42] Given the
antiquity of the Indo-European [Hittite](Hittite_language "wikilink")
and [Luwian](Luwian_language "wikilink") languages, some scholars have
proposed [Anatolia as the hypothetical
centre](Anatolian_hypothesis "wikilink") from which the Indo-European
languages radiated.[^43] The first empire in the area was founded by the
Hittites, from the 18th through the 13th centuries BC. The
[Assyrians](Assyria "wikilink") conquered and settled parts of
southeastern Turkey as early as 1950 BC[^44] although they [have
remained a minority](Assyrian_continuity "wikilink") in the region.[^45]

Following the collapse of the Hittite empire
`{{circa|1180 BC}}`{=mediawiki}, the [Phrygians](Phrygia "wikilink"), an
Indo-European people, achieved ascendancy in Anatolia until their
kingdom was destroyed by the [Cimmerians](Cimmerians "wikilink") in
`{{circa|695 BC}}`{=mediawiki}.[^46] The most powerful of Phrygia\'s
successor states were [Lydia](Lydia "wikilink"),
[Caria](Caria "wikilink") and [Lycia](Lycia "wikilink").

[Assyrian](Assyria "wikilink") king [Shalmaneser
I](Shalmaneser_I "wikilink") (1263--1234 BC) recorded a campaign in
which he subdued the entire territory of \"Uruatri\".[^47][^48]
[Urartu](Urartu "wikilink") re-emerged in Assyrian inscriptions in the
9th century BC.[^49] Starting from 714 BC, the Urartu state began to
decline and finally dissolved in 590 BC when it was conquered by the
[Medes](Medes "wikilink").[^50]

[Ephesus](Ephesus "wikilink") was built by the
[Romans](Roman_Empire "wikilink") in 114--117.[^53] The [Temple of
Artemis](Temple_of_Artemis "wikilink") in Ephesus, built by king
[Croesus](Croesus "wikilink") of [Lydia](Lydia "wikilink") in the 6th
century BC, was one of the [Seven Wonders of the Ancient
World](Seven_Wonders_of_the_Ancient_World "wikilink").[^54]](Ephesus_Celsus_Library_Faade.jpg "The Library of Celsus in Ephesus was built by the Romans in 114117. The Temple of Artemis in Ephesus, built by king Croesus of Lydia in the 6th century BC, was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.")
Before 1200 BC, there were four Greek-speaking settlements in
Anatolia.[^57] Around 1000 BC, [Greek
migrations](Iron_Age_Greek_migrations "wikilink") to the west coast of
Anatolia began; Greek communities were influential mostly in these areas
until [Alexander the Great](Alexander_the_Great "wikilink").[^58][^59]
Numerous important [cities](polis "wikilink") were founded by these
colonists, such as [Miletus](Miletus "wikilink"),
[Ephesus](Ephesus "wikilink"),
[Halicarnassus](Halicarnassus "wikilink"),
[Pergamon](Pergamon "wikilink"), [Aphrodisias](Aphrodisias "wikilink"),
[Smyrna](Smyrna "wikilink") (now [zmir](zmir "wikilink")) and
[Byzantium](Byzantium "wikilink") (now [Istanbul](Istanbul "wikilink")),
the latter founded by Greek colonists from [Megara](Megara "wikilink")
in `{{circa|667 BC}}`{=mediawiki}.[^60] Some of the most prominent
[pre-Socratic philosophers](Pre-Socratic_philosophy "wikilink") lived in
Miletus. [Thales of Miletus](Thales_of_Miletus "wikilink") is regarded
as the first philosopher in the [Greek
tradition](Ancient_Greek_philosophy "wikilink")[^61][^62] and is also
historically recognized as the first individual known to have engaged in
[scientific
philosophy](History_of_science#Pre-socratics "wikilink").[^63][^64]

The [Armenian](Armenians "wikilink") [Orontid
dynasty](Orontid_dynasty "wikilink"), which included parts of what is
now eastern Turkey, began in the 6th century BC. In northwestern Turkey,
the most significant tribal group in ancient [Thrace](Thrace "wikilink")
was the [Odyrisians](Odrysian_kingdom "wikilink"), founded by [Teres
I](Teres_I "wikilink").[^65]

All of modern-day Turkey was conquered by the Persian [Achaemenid
Empire](Achaemenid_Empire "wikilink") during the 6th century BC.[^66]
The [Greco-Persian Wars](Greco-Persian_Wars "wikilink") started when the
Greek city-states on the coast of Anatolia rebelled against Persian rule
in 499 BC. Queen [Artemisia I](Artemisia_I_of_Caria "wikilink") of
Halicarnassus, which was then within the Achaemenid
[satrapy](Satrap "wikilink") of [Caria](Caria "wikilink"), fought as an
ally of [Xerxes I](Xerxes_I "wikilink"), King of Persia, against the
independent Greek city-states during the [second Persian invasion of
Greece](second_Persian_invasion_of_Greece "wikilink") in 480
BC.[^67][^68]

Anatolia fell to Alexander the Great in 334 BC,[^69] which led to
increasing cultural homogeneity and
[Hellenization](Hellenization "wikilink") in the area,[^70] which met
resistance.[^71] Following Alexander\'s death in 323 BC, Anatolia was
subsequently divided into smaller [Hellenistic
kingdoms](Hellenistic_period "wikilink"), all of which became part of
the [Roman Republic](Roman_Republic "wikilink") by the mid-1st century
BC.[^72] Hellenization accelerated under Roman rule, and by the early
centuries of the [Christian Era](Early_Christianity "wikilink") the
local Anatolian languages and cultures had become extinct, being largely
replaced by ancient Greek language and culture.[^73]

From the 1st century BC up to the 3rd century AD, large parts of
modern-day Turkey were contested between the Romans and neighboring
[Parthians](Parthian_Empire "wikilink") through the [Roman-Parthian
Wars](Roman-Parthian_Wars "wikilink").

[Galatia](Galatia "wikilink") was an ancient area in the highlands of
central Anatolia inhabited by the [Celts](Celts "wikilink"). The term
\"Galatians\" came to be used by the Greeks for the three Celtic peoples
of Anatolia: the [Tectosages](Tectosages "wikilink"), the
[Trocmii](Trocmii "wikilink"), and the
[Tolistobogii](Tolistobogii "wikilink").[^74][^75] By the 1st century BC
the Celts had become so Hellenized that some Greek writers called them
*Hellenogalatai*.[^76] The [Kingdom of
Pontus](Kingdom_of_Pontus "wikilink") was a Hellenistic kingdom,
centered in the historical region of
[Pontus](Pontus_(region) "wikilink") and ruled by the [Mithridatic
dynasty](Mithridatic_dynasty "wikilink") of Persian
origin,[^77][^78][^79][^80] which may have been directly related to
[Darius the Great](Darius_the_Great "wikilink").[^81][^82] The kingdom
was proclaimed by [Mithridates I](Mithridates_I_of_Pontus "wikilink") in
281 BC and lasted until its conquest by the Romans in 63 BC. Pontus
reached its largest extent under [Mithridates
VI](Mithridates_VI "wikilink") the Great, who conquered Colchis,
Cappadocia, Bithynia, and the Greek colonies of the Tauric Chersonesos.
After a long struggle with Rome in the [Mithridatic
Wars](Mithridatic_Wars "wikilink"), Pontus was defeated. All [ancient
regions and territories](ancient_regions_of_Anatolia "wikilink")
corresponding to modern Turkey eventually became part of the [Roman
Empire](Roman_Empire "wikilink"), and many of them retained their
historic [names in classical
antiquity](Ancient_regions_of_Anatolia#Classical_Age_regions_(circa_200_BC) "wikilink")
as [Roman provinces](Roman_provinces "wikilink").

[Constantine the Great](Constantine_the_Great "wikilink")\'s death in
337. In 330, [Constantinople](Constantinople "wikilink") (now
[Istanbul](Istanbul "wikilink")) became the new Roman
capital.](ConstantineEmpire.jpg "The Roman Empire at the time of Constantine the Great's death in 337. In 330, Constantinople (now Istanbul) became the new Roman capital.")
According to the [Acts of Apostles](Acts_of_Apostles "wikilink"),[^83]
[Antioch](Antioch "wikilink") (now [Antakya](Antakya "wikilink")), a
city in southern Turkey, is where the followers of
[Jesus](Jesus "wikilink") were [first
called](Early_Christianity "wikilink")
\"[Christians](Christians "wikilink")\". The city quickly became an
important center of Christianity.[^84][^85] The [Apostle
Paul](Paul_the_Apostle "wikilink") of
[Tarsus](Tarsus,_Mersin "wikilink") traveled to
[Ephesus](Ephesus "wikilink") and stayed there, probably working as a
tentmaker.[^86] He is claimed to have performed
[miracles](miracle "wikilink") and organized missionary activity in
other regions.[^87] Paul left Ephesus after an attack from a local
silversmith resulted in a pro-[Artemis](Artemis "wikilink") riot.[^88]

According to [extrabiblical
traditions](John_the_Apostle#Extrabiblical_traditions "wikilink"), the
[Assumption of Mary](Assumption_of_Mary "wikilink") took place in
Ephesus, where [Apostle John](John_the_Apostle "wikilink") was also
present. [Irenaeus](Irenaeus "wikilink") writes of \"the church of
Ephesus, founded by Paul, with John continuing with them until the times
of [Trajan](Trajan "wikilink").\"[^89] While in Ephesus, Apostle John
wrote the [three epistles](Johannine_epistles "wikilink") attributed to
him. The [Basilica of St. John](Basilica_of_St._John "wikilink") near
Ephesus, built by [Justinian the Great](Justinian_I "wikilink") in the
6th century, marks the [burial site of Apostle
John](Basilica_of_St._John#St._John_in_Ephesus "wikilink"), while the
nearby [House of the Virgin Mary](House_of_the_Virgin_Mary "wikilink")
is accepted by the Catholic church as the place where [Mary, mother of
Jesus](Mary,_mother_of_Jesus "wikilink"), lived the final days of her
life before her Assumption. [Saint Nicholas](Saint_Nicholas "wikilink"),
born in [Patara](Patara_(Lycia) "wikilink"), lived in nearby
[Myra](Myra "wikilink") (modern [Demre](Demre "wikilink")) in
[Lycia](Lycia "wikilink").

In 123, Roman emperor [Hadrian](Hadrian "wikilink") traveled to
Anatolia. Numerous monuments were erected for his arrival, and he met
his lover [Antinous](Antinous "wikilink") from
[Bithynia](Bithynia "wikilink").[^90] Hadrian focused on the Greek
revival and built several temples and improved the cities.
[Cyzicus](Cyzicus "wikilink"), [Pergamon](Pergamon "wikilink"),
[Smyrna](Smyrna "wikilink"), [Ephesus](Ephesus "wikilink") and
[Sardes](Sardes "wikilink") were promoted as regional centres for the
[Imperial cult](Roman_imperial_cult "wikilink") during this period.[^91]

```
![The [Hagia Sophia](Hagia_Sophia "wikilink") in
[Constantinople](Constantinople "wikilink") (now
[Istanbul](Istanbul "wikilink")) was built by the [Eastern
Roman](Byzantine_Empire "wikilink") emperor [Justinian the
Great](Justinian_the_Great "wikilink") in
532--537.[^92]](Aya_Sophia_(7144824757).jpg "The Hagia Sophia in Constantinople (now Istanbul) was built by the Eastern Roman emperor Justinian the Great in 532537.")
After defeating [Licinius](Licinius "wikilink") (the [senior co-emperor
(*augustus*) of the East](Tetrarchy#Regions_and_capitals "wikilink") in
[Nicomedia](Nicomedia "wikilink")) at the [Battle of
Chrysopolis](Battle_of_Chrysopolis "wikilink")
([skdar](skdar "wikilink")) in 324 (thus bringing an end to the
[Tetrarchy](Tetrarchy "wikilink") system and becoming the sole emperor),
[Constantine the Great](Constantine_the_Great "wikilink") chose the
nearby city of [Byzantium](Byzantium "wikilink") as the new capital of
the Roman Empire and started rebuilding and expanding the city. In 330
he officially proclaimed it as the new Roman capital with the name [New
Rome](New_Rome "wikilink") (*Nova Roma*) but soon afterwards renamed it
[Constantinople](Constantinople "wikilink") (*Constantinopolis*, modern
[Istanbul](Istanbul "wikilink")). Under Constantine, Christianity did
not become the official religion of the state, but Christianity enjoyed
imperial preference since [he supported it with generous
privileges](Constantine_the_Great_and_Christianity "wikilink").

![The [Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire](Byzantine_Empire "wikilink") in
555 under [Justinian the Great](Justinian_the_Great "wikilink"), at its
greatest extent since the fall of the [Western Roman
Empire](Western_Roman_Empire "wikilink") in
476](Justinian555AD.png "The Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire in 555 under Justinian the Great, at its greatest extent since the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476")
[Theodosius the Great](Theodosius_I "wikilink") made Christianity the
[official state
religion](Christianity_as_the_Roman_state_religion "wikilink") of the
Roman Empire with the [Edict of
Thessalonica](Edict_of_Thessalonica "wikilink") in 380. Following the
death of Theodosius in 395 and the permanent division of the Roman
Empire between his two sons, Constantinople became the capital of the
Eastern Roman Empire. This empire, which would later be branded by
historians as the [Byzantine Empire](Byzantine_Empire "wikilink"), ruled
most of the territory of present-day Turkey until the [Late Middle
Ages](Late_Middle_Ages "wikilink");[^94] although the eastern regions
remained firmly in [Sasanian](Sasanian "wikilink") hands until the 7th
century. The frequent [Byzantine-Sassanid
Wars](Byzantine-Sassanid_Wars "wikilink"), a continuation of the
centuries-long [Roman-Persian Wars](Roman-Persian_Wars "wikilink"), took
place between the 4th and 7th centuries.

Several [ecumenical councils](ecumenical_councils "wikilink") of the
early Church were held in cities located in present-day Turkey,
including the [First Council of
Nicaea](First_Council_of_Nicaea "wikilink") ([Iznik](Iznik "wikilink"))
in 325 (which resulted in the first uniform Christian
[doctrine](doctrine "wikilink"), called the [Nicene
Creed](Nicene_Creed "wikilink")), the [First Council of
Constantinople](First_Council_of_Constantinople "wikilink") in 381, the
[Council of Ephesus](Council_of_Ephesus "wikilink") in 431, and the
[Council of Chalcedon](Council_of_Chalcedon "wikilink") in 451.[^95]
During most of its existence, the Byzantine Empire was one of the most
powerful economic, cultural, and military forces in Europe.[^96]
Established in the Roman period, the [Ecumenical Patriarchate of
Constantinople](Ecumenical_Patriarchate_of_Constantinople "wikilink") is
the oldest continuously active institution in Istanbul.[^97]

The [House of Seljuk](Seljuq_dynasty "wikilink") originated from the
*[Knk](Knk_(tribe) "wikilink")* branch of the [Oghuz
Turks](Oghuz_Turks "wikilink") who resided in the [Yabgu
Khaganate](Oghuz_Yabgu_State "wikilink"), on the periphery of the
[Muslim world](Islamic_Golden_Age "wikilink"), in the 9th century.[^98]
From eastern [Caspian Sea](Caspian_Sea "wikilink") area, Oghuz tribes
and other Turks started to migrate into
[Khorasan](Greater_Khorasan "wikilink"). The [Abbasid
Caliphate](Abbasid_Caliphate "wikilink")\'s capital,
[Baghdad](Baghdad "wikilink"), which was the seat of religious and
political leadership of the Islamic world, was taken by Seljuks in
1055.[^99] In the latter half of the 11th century, the Seljuk Turks
began penetrating into [medieval Armenia](medieval_Armenia "wikilink")
and Anatolia. In 1071, the Seljuks defeated the Byzantines at the
[Battle of Manzikert](Battle_of_Manzikert "wikilink"), starting the
[Turkification](Turkification "wikilink") process in the area; the
Turkish language and Islam were introduced to Anatolia. The slow
transition from a predominantly Christian and Greek-speaking Anatolia to
a predominantly Muslim and Turkish-speaking one was underway.

The [Mevlevi Order](Mevlevi_Order "wikilink") of
[dervishes](dervishes "wikilink"), established in
[Konya](Konya "wikilink") during the 13th century by
[Sufi](Sufi "wikilink") poet [Mevln Rm](Rumi "wikilink"), played a
role in the [Islamization](Islamization "wikilink") of the diverse
people of Anatolia.[^100][^101] Thus, alongside the Turkification of the
territory, the [culturally Persianized](Persianate_society "wikilink")
Seljuks set the basis for a [Turko-Persian principal
culture](Turko-Persian_tradition "wikilink") in
Anatolia.[^102][^103][^104]

The defeat of the Seljuk armies by the
[Mongols](Mongol_Empire "wikilink") in
[1243](Battle_of_Kse_Da "wikilink") caused the territories of the
Seljuk [Sultanate of Rm](Sultanate_of_Rum "wikilink") to slowly
disintegrate into small [Turkish
principalities](Anatolian_beyliks "wikilink").[^105]

### Ottoman Empire {#ottoman_empire}

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Ottoman Empire}}
```
[thumb\|upright=1.2\|The [Ottoman Empire](Ottoman_Empire "wikilink") at
its greatest European extent, in 1683, during the [Battle of
Vienna](Battle_of_Vienna "wikilink")](File:OttomanEmpireMain.png "wikilink")
In the early 14th century, the [Ottoman
Beylik](Rise_of_the_Ottoman_Empire "wikilink") founded by [Osman
I](Osman_I "wikilink") started expanding its territory and annexing the
nearby Turkish beyliks (principalities) in Anatolia. Within a few
decades, during the reign of [Murad I](Murad_I "wikilink") (r.
1362--1389), the Ottoman state began expanding into the
[Balkans](Balkans "wikilink"), eventually becoming known as the [Ottoman
Empire](Ottoman_Empire "wikilink"). The Ottomans under [Mehmed
II](Mehmed_II "wikilink") completed their conquest of the Byzantine
Empire by [capturing its capital,
Constantinople](Fall_of_Constantinople "wikilink"), on 29 May 1453. The
empire was further expanded in Anatolia and the Balkan peninsula.[^106]

Following the end of the [Reconquista](Reconquista "wikilink"), which
resulted in the [expulsion of
non-Christians](Reconquista#Conversions_and_expulsions "wikilink") (Jews
and Muslims) from [Iberia](Iberia "wikilink") and [southern
Italy](Kingdom_of_Naples "wikilink") controlled by the Crowns of
[Castile](Crown_of_Castile "wikilink") and
[Aragon](Crown_of_Aragon "wikilink") (and later by the [Spanish
Empire](Spanish_Empire "wikilink")), a large number of [Sephardic
Jews](History_of_the_Jews_in_the_Ottoman_Empire "wikilink") and
[Andalusian Muslims](Al-Andalus "wikilink")
[emigrated](Bayezid_II#Jewish_and_Muslim_immigration "wikilink") to the
Ottoman Empire during the reigns of sultan [Bayezid
II](Bayezid_II "wikilink") and his successors, settling primarily in
[Istanbul](Istanbul "wikilink"), [zmir](zmir "wikilink"),
[Selanik](Thessaloniki "wikilink"), [Bursa](Bursa "wikilink") and
[Edirne](Edirne "wikilink").[^107]

From the second half of the 18th century onwards, the [Ottoman Empire
began to decline](Decline_of_the_Ottoman_Empire "wikilink"). The
[Tanzimat](Tanzimat "wikilink") reforms, initiated by [Mahmud
II](Mahmud_II "wikilink") in 1839, aimed to modernize the Ottoman state
in line with the progress that had been made in Western Europe. The
efforts of [Midhat Pasha](Midhat_Pasha "wikilink") during the late
Tanzimat era led the Ottoman [constitutional movement of
1876](Ottoman_constitution_of_1876 "wikilink"), which introduced the
[First Constitutional Era](First_Constitutional_Era "wikilink"), but
these efforts proved to be inadequate in most fields, and failed to stop
the [dissolution of the
empire](Dissolution_of_the_Ottoman_Empire "wikilink").[^108]

![The [Sleymaniye Mosque](Sleymaniye_Mosque "wikilink") is the largest
Ottoman imperial mosque in [Istanbul](Istanbul "wikilink"), located on
the [Third Hill](Seven_hills_of_Istanbul "wikilink") in the city\'s
[historical peninsula](Constantinople "wikilink"). The mosque was
commissioned by [Suleiman the
Magnificent](Suleiman_the_Magnificent "wikilink") and designed by the
imperial architect [Mimar
Sinan](Mimar_Sinan "wikilink").](Suleymaniye_DSCF3573.jpg "The Sleymaniye Mosque is the largest Ottoman imperial mosque in Istanbul, located on the Third Hill in the city's historical peninsula. The mosque was commissioned by Suleiman the Magnificent and designed by the imperial architect Mimar Sinan.")

As the empire gradually shrank in size, military power and wealth;
especially after the [Ottoman economic crisis and
default](Great_Eastern_Crisis "wikilink") in 1875[^109] which led to
uprisings in the Balkan provinces that culminated in the [Russo-Turkish
War (1877--1878)](Russo-Turkish_War_(18771878) "wikilink"); many Balkan
Muslims migrated to the empire\'s heartland in Anatolia,[^110][^111]
along with the [Circassians](Circassians "wikilink") fleeing the
[Russian conquest](RussianCircassian_War "wikilink") of the
[Caucasus](Russian_conquest_of_the_Caucasus "wikilink"). According to
some estimates, 800,000 Muslim [Circassians](Circassians "wikilink")
died during the [Circassian genocide](Circassian_genocide "wikilink") in
the territory of present-day Russia, the survivors of which sought
refuge in the [Ottoman Empire](Ottoman_Empire "wikilink"), mostly
settling in the provinces of present-day Turkey. The decline of the
Ottoman Empire led to a [rise in nationalist sentiment among its various
subject
peoples](Rise_of_nationalism_under_the_Ottoman_Empire "wikilink"),
leading to increased ethnic tensions which occasionally burst into
violence, such as the [Hamidian
massacres](Hamidian_massacres "wikilink") of
[Armenians](Armenians_in_the_Ottoman_Empire "wikilink"), which claimed
up to 300,000 lives.[^112]

Ottoman territories in Europe ([Rumelia](Rumelia "wikilink")) were lost
in the [First Balkan War](First_Balkan_War "wikilink")
(1912--1913).[^113] Ottomans managed to recover some territory in
Europe, such as [Edirne](Edirne "wikilink"), in the [Second Balkan
War](Second_Balkan_War "wikilink") (1913). In the 19th and early 20th
centuries, [persecution of Muslims during the Ottoman
contraction](persecution_of_Muslims_during_the_Ottoman_contraction "wikilink")
and [in the Russian
Empire](Persecution_of_Muslims#Russian_Empire "wikilink") resulted in
estimated 5 million deaths,[^114][^115] with more than 3 million in
Balkans;[^116] the casualties included Turks.[^117] Five to seven or
seven to nine million [refugees](Muhacir "wikilink") migrated into
modern-day Turkey from the [Balkans](Balkans "wikilink"),
[Caucasus](Caucasus "wikilink"), [Crimea](Crimean_Khanate "wikilink"),
and [Mediterranean](Mediterranean "wikilink")
islands,[^118][^119][^120][^121] shifting the center of the Ottoman
Empire to Anatolia.[^122] In addition to a small number of Jews, the
refugees were overwhelmingly Muslim; they were both Turkish and
non-Turkish people, such as [Circassians](Circassians "wikilink") and
[Crimean Tatars](Crimean_Tatars "wikilink").[^123][^124] [Paul
Mojzes](Paul_Mojzes "wikilink") has called the Balkan Wars an
\"unrecognized genocide\", where multiple sides were both victims and
perpetrators.[^125] `{{Multiple image

against British forces in the first two years of the [Mesopotamian
campaign](Mesopotamian_campaign "wikilink"), such as the [Siege of
Kut](Siege_of_Kut "wikilink"); but the [Arab
Revolt](Arab_Revolt "wikilink") turned the tide against the Ottomans in
the Middle East. In the [Caucasus
campaign](Caucasus_campaign "wikilink"), however, the Russian forces had
the upper hand from the beginning, especially after the [Battle of
Sarikamish](Battle_of_Sarikamish "wikilink"). Russian forces advanced
into northeastern Anatolia and controlled the major cities there until
retreating from World War I with the [Treaty of
Brest-Litovsk](Treaty_of_Brest-Litovsk "wikilink") following the
[Russian Revolution](Russian_Revolution "wikilink").

During the war, the empire\'s Armenian subjects were [deported to
Syria](Temporary_Law_of_Deportation "wikilink") as part of the [Armenian
genocide](Armenian_genocide "wikilink"). As a result, an estimated
600,000[^126] to more than 1 million,[^127] or up to 1.5
million[^128][^129][^130]
[Armenians](Armenians_in_the_Ottoman_Empire "wikilink") were killed. The
Turkish government has [refused to
acknowledge](Armenian_genocide_denial "wikilink")[^131][^132] the events
as genocide and states that Armenians were only
[\"relocated](Population_transfer "wikilink")\" from the eastern war
zone.[^133] [Genocidal campaigns](Late_Ottoman_genocides "wikilink")
were also committed against the empire\'s other minority groups such as
the [Assyrians](Assyrian_genocide "wikilink") and
[Greeks](Greek_genocide "wikilink").[^134][^135][^136] Following the
[Armistice of Mudros](Armistice_of_Mudros "wikilink") in 1918, the
victorious [Allied Powers](Allies_of_World_War_I "wikilink") sought the
[partition of the Ottoman
Empire](partition_of_the_Ottoman_Empire "wikilink") through the 1920
[Treaty of Svres](Treaty_of_Svres "wikilink").[^137]

### Republic of Turkey {#republic_of_turkey}

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|History of the Republic of Turkey}}
```
![[Kemal Atatrk](Mustafa_Kemal_Atatrk "wikilink"), the
[founder](List_of_national_founders "wikilink") and the [first
President](List_of_presidents_of_Turkey "wikilink") of the Turkish
Republic](Atatrk_apkasyla_selam_verirken.jpg "Kemal Atatrk, the founder and the first President of the Turkish Republic")
The [occupation of Istanbul](occupation_of_Istanbul "wikilink") (1918)
and [zmir](Occupation_of_Smyrna "wikilink") (1919) by the
[Allies](Allies_of_World_War_I "wikilink") in the aftermath of World War
I initiated the [Turkish National
Movement](Turkish_National_Movement "wikilink"). Under the leadership of
[Mustafa Kemal Pasha](Mustafa_Kemal_Atatrk "wikilink"), a military
commander who had distinguished himself during the [Battle of
Gallipoli](Gallipoli_campaign "wikilink"), the [Turkish War of
Independence](Turkish_War_of_Independence "wikilink") (1919--1923) was
waged with the aim of revoking the terms of the [Treaty of
Svres](Treaty_of_Svres "wikilink") (1920).[^138]

The [Turkish Provisional
Government](Government_of_the_Grand_National_Assembly "wikilink") in
[Ankara](Ankara "wikilink"), which had declared itself the legitimate
government of the country on [23 April
1920](Grand_National_Assembly_of_Turkey "wikilink"), started to
formalize the legal transition from the old Ottoman into the new
Republican political system. The Ankara Government engaged in armed and
diplomatic struggle. In 1921--1923, the Armenian, Greek, French, and
British armies had been expelled:[^139][^140][^141][^142] The military
advance and diplomatic success of the Ankara Government resulted in the
signing of the [Armistice of Mudanya](Armistice_of_Mudanya "wikilink")
on 11 October 1922. The handling of the [Chanak
Crisis](Chanak_Crisis "wikilink") (September--October 1922) between the
[United Kingdom](United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland "wikilink")
and the Ankara Government caused the collapse of [David Lloyd
George](David_Lloyd_George "wikilink")\'s
[Ministry](Lloyd_George_ministry "wikilink") on 19 October 1922[^143]
and political autonomy of [Canada](Canada "wikilink") from the UK.[^144]
On 1 November 1922, the Turkish Parliament in Ankara formally abolished
the Sultanate, thus ending 623 years of
[monarchical](monarchy "wikilink") Ottoman rule.

The [Treaty of Lausanne](Treaty_of_Lausanne "wikilink") of 24 July 1923,
which superseded the Treaty of Svres,[^145][^146] led to the
international recognition of the sovereignty of the new Turkish state as
the successor state of the Ottoman Empire. On 4 October 1923, the Allied
occupation of Turkey ended with the withdrawal of the last Allied troops
from [Istanbul](Occupation_of_Istanbul "wikilink"). The Turkish Republic
was officially proclaimed on 29 October 1923 in Ankara, the country\'s
new capital.[^147] The [Lausanne
Convention](Convention_Concerning_the_Exchange_of_Greek_and_Turkish_Populations "wikilink")
stipulated a [population exchange between Greece and
Turkey](population_exchange_between_Greece_and_Turkey "wikilink").[^148]

![[Antkabir](Antkabir "wikilink") in [Ankara](Ankara "wikilink") was
completed in 1953 to become the mausoleum of [Mustafa Kemal
Atatrk](Mustafa_Kemal_Atatrk "wikilink")](Ankara_asv2021-10_img04_Antkabir.jpg "Antkabir in Ankara was completed in 1953 to become the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Atatrk")

Mustafa Kemal became the republic\'s first
[president](President_of_Turkey "wikilink") and introduced [many
reforms](Atatrk's_reforms "wikilink"). The reforms aimed to transform
the old [religion-based and
multi-communal](Millet_(Ottoman_Empire) "wikilink") Ottoman monarchy
into a Turkish [nation state](nation_state "wikilink") that would be
governed as a [parliamentary
republic](parliamentary_republic "wikilink") under a [secular
constitution](Turkish_Constitution_of_1924 "wikilink").[^149] With the
[Surname Law](Surname_Law_(Turkey) "wikilink") of 1934, the [Turkish
Parliament](Grand_National_Assembly_of_Turkey "wikilink") bestowed upon
Kemal the honorific surname \"Atatrk\" (*Father Turk*).[^150]
Atatrk\'s reforms caused discontent in some [Kurdish](Kurds "wikilink")
and [Zaza](Zazas "wikilink") tribes leading to the [Sheikh Said
rebellion](Sheikh_Said_rebellion "wikilink") in 1925[^151] and the
[Dersim rebellion](Dersim_rebellion "wikilink") in 1937.[^152]

[smet nn](smet_nn "wikilink") became the country\'s second
president following Atatrk\'s death in 1938. In 1939, the [Republic of
Hatay](Hatay_State "wikilink") voted in favor of joining Turkey with a
referendum. Turkey [remained
neutral](Second_Cairo_Conference "wikilink") during most of [World War
II](World_War_II "wikilink") but entered the war on the side of the
[Allies](Allies_of_World_War_II "wikilink") on [23 February
1945](Turkish_declaration_of_war_on_Germany_and_Japan "wikilink"). Later
that year, Turkey became a [charter
member](United_Nations_Charter "wikilink") of the United Nations.[^153]
In 1950 Turkey became a member of the [Council of
Europe](Council_of_Europe "wikilink"). After fighting as part of the
[UN](United_Nations "wikilink") forces in the [Korean
War](Korean_War "wikilink"), Turkey joined [NATO](NATO "wikilink") in
1952, becoming a bulwark against Soviet expansion into the
[Mediterranean](Mediterranean_Basin "wikilink").

The country\'s transition to [multi-party
democracy](Multi-party_period_of_the_Republic_of_Turkey "wikilink") was
interrupted by military coups in
[1960](1960_Turkish_coup_d'tat "wikilink") and
[1980](1980_Turkish_coup_d'tat "wikilink"), as well as by military
memorandums in [1971](1971_Turkish_military_memorandum "wikilink") and
[1997](1997_Turkish_military_memorandum "wikilink").[^154][^155] Between
1960 and the end of the 20th century, the prominent leaders in Turkish
politics who achieved multiple election victories were [Sleyman
Demirel](Sleyman_Demirel "wikilink"), [Blent
Ecevit](Blent_Ecevit "wikilink") and [Turgut
zal](Turgut_zal "wikilink"). [Tansu iller](Tansu_iller "wikilink")
became the first female prime minister of Turkey in 1993. ![[Tansu
iller](Tansu_iller "wikilink"), Turkey\'s first female prime minister,

in January
1994](Visit_of_Tansu_iller,_Turkish_Prime_Minister,_to_the_EC_6.jpg "Tansu iller, Turkey's first female prime minister, attends a European Commission meeting in January 1994")
Turkey applied for full membership of the EEC in 1987, joined the
[European Union Customs Union](European_Union_Customs_Union "wikilink")
in 1995 and started [accession
negotiations](Accession_of_Turkey_to_the_European_Union "wikilink") with
the [European Union](European_Union "wikilink") in 2005.[^156][^157] In
a non-binding vote on 13 March 2019, the [European
Parliament](European_Parliament "wikilink") called on the EU governments
to suspend EU accession talks with Turkey, citing violations of human
rights and the rule of law; but the negotiations, effectively on hold
since 2018, remain active as of 2023.[^158]

In 2014, prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoan won Turkey\'s first direct
[presidential
election](2014_Turkish_presidential_election "wikilink").[^159] On 15
July 2016, an [unsuccessful coup
attempt](2016_Turkish_coup_attempt "wikilink") tried to oust the
government.[^160] With a [referendum in
2017](2017_Turkish_constitutional_referendum "wikilink"), the
parliamentary republic was replaced by an [executive presidential
system](executive_president "wikilink"). The office of the prime
minister was abolished, and its powers and duties were transferred to
the president. On the referendum day, while the voting was still
underway, the [Supreme Electoral
Council](Supreme_Election_Council_(Turkey) "wikilink") lifted a rule
that required each ballot to have an official stamp.[^161] The
opposition parties claimed that as many as 2.5 million [ballots without
a
stamp](2017_Turkish_constitutional_referendum#Unstamped_ballots "wikilink")
were accepted as valid.[^162]

## Administrative divisions {#administrative_divisions}

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Turkey}}
```
```{=mediawiki}
{{Further|Regions of Turkey|NUTS of Turkey}}
```
Turkey has a [unitary](unitary_state "wikilink") structure in terms of
public administration, and the provinces are subordinate to the [central
government](central_government "wikilink") in
[Ankara](Ankara "wikilink"). In province centers the government is
represented by the province governors (*vali*) and in towns by the
governors (*kaymakam*). Other senior public officials are also appointed
by the central government, except for the mayors (*belediye bakan*)
who are elected by the constituents.[^163] Turkish municipalities have
local legislative bodies (*belediye meclisi*) for decision-making on
municipal issues.

Turkey is subdivided into 81 [provinces](Provinces_of_Turkey "wikilink")
(*il* or *vilayet*) for administrative purposes. Each province is
divided into [districts](Districts_of_Turkey "wikilink") (*ile*), for a
total of 973 districts.[^164] Turkey is also subdivided into 7
[regions](Geographical_regions_of_Turkey "wikilink") (*blge*) and 21
subregions for geographic, demographic and economic measurements,
surveys and classifications; this does not refer to an administrative
division.

Turkey is a [presidential republic](presidential_system "wikilink")
within a [multi-party
system](Multi-party_period_of_the_Republic_of_Turkey "wikilink").[^165]
The [current constitution](Constitution_of_Turkey "wikilink") was
approved by [referendum in
1982](1982_Turkish_constitutional_referendum "wikilink"), which
determines the government\'s structure, lays forth the ideals and
standards of the state\'s conduct, and sets out the state\'s
responsibility to its citizens. Furthermore, the constitution specifies
the people\'s rights and obligations, as well as principles for the
delegation and exercise of sovereignty that belongs to the people of
Turkey.[^166] Turkish politics have become increasingly associated with
[democratic backsliding](democratic_backsliding "wikilink"), being
described as a [competitive authoritarian](Hybrid_regime "wikilink")
system.[^167][^168]

In the Turkish unitary system, citizens are subject to [three levels of
government](Administrative_divisions_of_Turkey "wikilink"): national,
provincial, and local. The [local
government](local_government "wikilink")\'s duties are commonly split
between [municipal governments](municipal_corporation "wikilink") and
districts, in which the executive and legislative officials are elected
by a [plurality vote](Plurality_voting "wikilink") of citizens by
district. The government comprises three branches:

-   [Legislative](Legislature "wikilink"): The
    [unicameral](unicameralism "wikilink")
    [Parliament](Grand_National_Assembly_of_Turkey "wikilink") makes
    laws, debates and adopts the budget bills, [declares
    war](declaration_of_war "wikilink"), approves treaties, proclaims
    [amnesty](amnesty "wikilink") and [pardon](pardon "wikilink"), and
    has the power of [impeachment](impeachment "wikilink"), by which it
    can remove incumbent members of the government.[^169]
-   [Executive](Executive_(government) "wikilink"): The president is the
    [commander-in-chief](commander-in-chief "wikilink") of the military,
    can veto [legislative bills](bill_(law) "wikilink") before they
    become law (subject to parliamentary override), can issue
    [presidential decrees](Decree "wikilink") on matters regarding
    executive power with the exception of fundamental rights, individual
    rights and certain political rights (parliamentary laws prevail
    presidential decrees), and appoints the [members of the
    Cabinet](Cabinet_of_Turkey "wikilink") and other officers, who
    administer and enforce national laws and policies.[^170]
-   [Judicial](Judicial_system_of_Turkey "wikilink"): The
    [Constitutional Court](Constitutional_Court_of_Turkey "wikilink")
    (for [constitutional adjudication](constitutionality "wikilink") and
    review of individual applications concerning human rights), the
    [Court of Cassation](Court_of_Cassation_(Turkey) "wikilink") (final
    decision maker in ordinary judiciary), the [Council of
    State](Council_of_State_(Turkey) "wikilink") (final decision maker
    in administrative judiciary) and the [Court of Jurisdictional
    Disputes](Court_of_Jurisdictional_Disputes "wikilink") (for
    resolving the disputes between courts for constitutional
    jurisdiction`{{Clarify|reason=As they are not mentioned in https://www.ft.com/content/bafda53b-87bb-4480-8074-0cc91d4cab52 are they worth mentioning here|date=November 2023}}`{=mediawiki})
    are the four organizations that are described by the constitution as
    supreme courts. The judges of the Constitutional Court are appointed
    by the president and the parliament.[^171]

The Parliament has 600 voting members, each representing a constituency
for a five-year term. Parliamentary seats are distributed among the
provinces by population, conforming with the census apportionment. The
president is [elected](Turkish_presidential_elections "wikilink") by
[direct vote](Direct_election "wikilink") and serves a five-year term.
The president cannot run for re-election after two terms of five-years,
unless the parliament prematurely renews the presidential elections
during the second term. Elections for the Parliament and presidential
elections are held on the same day. The Constitutional Court is composed
of 15 members. A member is elected for a term of 12 years and cannot be
re-elected. The members of the Constitutional Court are obliged to
retire when they are over the age of 65.[^172]

Elections in Turkey are held for six functions of government:
[presidential elections](Turkish_presidential_elections "wikilink")
(national), parliamentary elections (national), [municipality
mayors](Metropolitan_municipalities_in_Turkey "wikilink") (local),
district mayors (local), provincial or [municipal council
members](List_of_municipalities_in_Turkey "wikilink") (local) and
[muhtars](Muhtar_(title) "wikilink") (local). Apart from elections,
[referendums](referendum "wikilink") are also held occasionally.

Every Turkish citizen who has turned 18 has the [right to
vote](Suffrage "wikilink") and stand as a candidate at elections.
[Universal suffrage](Universal_suffrage "wikilink") for both sexes has
been applied throughout Turkey since 1934 and before most countries. In
Turkey, [turnout rates](Voter_turnout "wikilink") of both local and
general elections are high compared to many other countries, which
usually stands higher than 80%.[^173] There are 600 members of
parliament who are elected for a five-year term by a [party-list
proportional
representation](party-list_proportional_representation "wikilink")
system from 88 electoral districts.

The Constitutional Court can strip the public financing of [political
parties](List_of_political_parties_in_Turkey "wikilink") that it deems
[anti-secular](secularism_in_Turkey "wikilink") or having ties to
[terrorism](Terrorism_in_Turkey "wikilink"), or ban their existence
altogether.[^174][^175] The [Interior
Ministry](Interior_Ministry_of_Turkey "wikilink") can block new parties
from elections even if a court rules in favour of the party.[^176] The
[electoral threshold](electoral_threshold "wikilink") for political
parties at national level is seven percent of the votes.[^177] Smaller
parties can avoid the electoral threshold by forming an alliance with
other parties. [Independent
candidates](Independent_politician "wikilink") are not subject to an
electoral threshold.

After World War II, starting from 1946, Turkey operated under a
[multi-party
system](Multi-party_period_of_the_Republic_of_Turkey "wikilink"). On the
right side of the Turkish [political
spectrum](political_spectrum "wikilink"), parties like the [Democrat
Party](Democrat_Party_(Turkey,_19461961) "wikilink"), [Justice
Party](Justice_Party_(Turkey) "wikilink"), [Motherland
Party](Motherland_Party_(Turkey) "wikilink"), and [Justice and
Development Party](Justice_and_Development_Party_(Turkey) "wikilink")
became the most popular political parties in Turkey, winning numerous
elections. Turkish [right-wing](Right-wing_politics "wikilink") parties
are more likely to embrace the principles of political ideologies such
as [conservatism](conservatism "wikilink"),
[nationalism](nationalism "wikilink") or
[Islamism](Islamism "wikilink").[^178] On the left side of the spectrum,
parties like the [Republican People\'s
Party](Republican_People's_Party "wikilink"), [Social Democratic
Populist Party](Social_Democratic_Populist_Party_(Turkey) "wikilink")
and [Democratic Left Party](Democratic_Left_Party_(Turkey) "wikilink")
once enjoyed the largest electoral success.
[Left-wing](Left-wing_politics "wikilink") parties are more likely to
embrace the principles of [socialism](socialism "wikilink"),
[Kemalism](Kemalism "wikilink") or
[secularism](secularism "wikilink").[^179]

President [Recep Tayyip Erdoan](Recep_Tayyip_Erdoan "wikilink"),
winner of the [2023 presidential
election](2023_Turkish_presidential_election "wikilink"),[^180][^181] is
currently serving as the [head of state](head_of_state "wikilink") and
[head of government](head_of_government "wikilink"). [zgr
zel](zgr_zel "wikilink") is the [Main Opposition
Leader](List_of_the_Main_Opposition_Leaders_of_Turkey "wikilink").
[Numan Kurtulmu](Numan_Kurtulmu "wikilink") is the [Speaker of the
Grand National
Assembly](Speaker_of_the_Grand_National_Assembly "wikilink"). The [2023
parliamentary election](2023_Turkish_parliamentary_election "wikilink")
resulted in the [28th Parliament of
Turkey](28th_Parliament_of_Turkey "wikilink"), which had an initial
composition of 268 seats for the Justice and Development Party, 169
seats for the Republican People\'s Party, 61 seats for the [Party of
Greens and the Left
Future](Party_of_Greens_and_the_Left_Future "wikilink"), 50 seats for
the [Nationalist Movement Party](Nationalist_Movement_Party "wikilink"),
43 seats for the [Good Party](Good_Party "wikilink"), 5 seats for the
[New Welfare Party](New_Welfare_Party "wikilink") and 4 seats for the
[Workers\' Party of
Turkey](Workers'_Party_of_Turkey_(2017) "wikilink").[^182] The next
parliamentary election is scheduled to take place in 2028.

### Law

{{Main|Judicial system of Turkey}}

![Istanbul Justice Palace in the ili district on the European
side](PalaceOfJusticeIstanbul_(1).jpg "Istanbul Justice Palace in the ili district on the European side")
![Istanbul Anadolu Justice Palace in the Kartal district on the Asian
side](stanbulAnadoluJusticePalace2.jpg "Istanbul Anadolu Justice Palace in the Kartal district on the Asian side")

With the founding of the Republic, Turkey adopted a [civil
law](Civil_law_(legal_system) "wikilink") legal system, replacing
[Sharia](Sharia "wikilink")-derived [Ottoman
law](Ottoman_law "wikilink"). The [Civil
Code](Turkish_civil_code_(1926) "wikilink"), adopted in 1926, was based
on the [Swiss Civil Code](Swiss_Civil_Code "wikilink") of 1907 and the
[Swiss Code of Obligations](Swiss_Code_of_Obligations "wikilink") of
1911. Although it underwent a number of changes in 2002, it retains much
of the basis of the original Code. The [Criminal
Code](Criminal_Code "wikilink"), originally based on the [Italian
Criminal Code](Italian_law_codes#Penal_Code "wikilink"), was replaced in
2005 by a Code with principles similar to the [German Penal
Code](German_Penal_Code "wikilink") and German law generally.
[Administrative law](Administrative_law "wikilink") is based on the
French equivalent and [procedural law](procedural_law "wikilink")
generally shows the influence of the Swiss, German and French legal
systems.[^183] Islamic principles do not play a part in the legal
system.[^184]

[Law enforcement in Turkey](Law_enforcement_in_Turkey "wikilink") is
carried out by several agencies under the jurisdiction of the [Ministry
of Internal Affairs](Ministry_of_the_Interior_(Turkey) "wikilink").
These agencies are the [General Directorate of
Security](General_Directorate_of_Security_(Turkey) "wikilink"), the
[Gendarmerie General Command](Gendarmerie_General_Command "wikilink")
and the [Coast Guard
Command](Coast_Guard_Command_(Turkey) "wikilink").`{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}`{=mediawiki}

In the years of government by the Justice and Development Party and
Erdoan, particularly since 2013, the independence and integrity of the
Turkish judiciary has increasingly been said to be in doubt by
institutions, parliamentarians and journalists both within and outside
of Turkey, because of political interference in the promotion of judges
and prosecutors and in their pursuit of public
duty.[^185][^186][^187][^188]

### Foreign relations {#foreign_relations}

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Foreign relations of Turkey}}
```
![Turkey has been in [formal accession
negotiations](Accession_of_Turkey_to_the_European_Union "wikilink") with
the [European Union](European_Union "wikilink") since
2005.[^189][^190]](EU_and_Turkey_Locator_Map.png "Turkey has been in formal accession negotiations with the European Union since 2005.")

In line with its traditional Western orientation, relations with Europe
have always been a central part of Turkish foreign policy. Turkey became
[one of the early
members](Member_states_of_the_Council_of_Europe "wikilink") of the
[Council of Europe](Council_of_Europe "wikilink") in 1950, applied for
associate membership of the
[EEC](European_Economic_Community "wikilink") (predecessor of the
European Union) in 1959 and became an [associate
member](Ankara_Agreement "wikilink") in 1963. After decades of political
negotiations, Turkey applied for full membership of the EEC in 1987,
became an associate member of the [Western European
Union](Western_European_Union "wikilink") in 1992, joined the [EU
Customs Union](European_Union_Customs_Union "wikilink") in 1995 and has
been in [formal accession
negotiations](Accession_of_Turkey_to_the_European_Union "wikilink") with
the [European Union](European_Union "wikilink") since 2005.[^193][^194]

Turkey\'s support for [Northern Cyprus](Northern_Cyprus "wikilink") in
the [Cyprus dispute](Cyprus_problem "wikilink") and refusal to include
the [Republic of Cyprus](Republic_of_Cyprus "wikilink") to the
[EU-Turkey Customs Union
agreement](European_UnionTurkey_Customs_Union "wikilink") complicates
its relations with the European Union and remains a major stumbling
block to the country\'s EU accession bid.[^195]

The other defining aspect of Turkey\'s foreign policy has been the
country\'s long-standing strategic alliance with the [United
States](TurkeyUnited_States_relations "wikilink").[^196][^197] The
[Truman Doctrine](Truman_Doctrine "wikilink") in 1947 enunciated
American intentions to guarantee the security of Turkey and Greece
during the [Cold War](Cold_War "wikilink"), and resulted in large-scale
U.S. military and economic support. In 1948 both countries were included
in the [Marshall Plan](Marshall_Plan "wikilink") and the
[OEEC](Organization_for_European_Economic_Co-operation "wikilink") for
rebuilding European economies.[^198] ![Turkey has been a member of
[NATO](NATO "wikilink") since 1952, has its second largest army and is
the host of the [Allied Land Command](Allied_Land_Command "wikilink")
headquarters.](300622-SanchezOTANSegunda3.jpg "Turkey has been a member of NATO since 1952, has its second largest army and is the host of the Allied Land Command headquarters.")
The common threat posed by the [Soviet Union](Soviet_Union "wikilink")
during the [Cold War](Cold_War "wikilink") led to Turkey\'s membership
of [NATO](NATO "wikilink") in 1952, ensuring close bilateral relations
with the US. Subsequently, Turkey benefited from the United States\'
political, economic and diplomatic support, including in key issues such
as the country\'s bid to join the European Union.[^199] In the
post--Cold War environment, Turkey\'s geostrategic importance shifted
towards its proximity to the [Middle East](Middle_East "wikilink"), the
[Caucasus](Caucasus "wikilink") and the Balkans.[^200]

The independence of the Turkic states of the Soviet Union in 1991, with
which Turkey shares a common cultural,
[historic](Turkic_history "wikilink") and
[linguistic](Turkic_languages "wikilink") heritage, allowed Turkey to
extend its economic and political relations deep into [Central
Asia](Central_Asia "wikilink").[^201] The [International Organization of
Turkic Culture](International_Organization_of_Turkic_Culture "wikilink")
(TURKSOY) was established in 1993, and the [Organization of Turkic
States](Organization_of_Turkic_States "wikilink") (OTS) was established
in 2009.

Under the [AKP](Justice_and_Development_Party_(Turkey) "wikilink")
government, Turkey\'s economy has grown rapidly and the country\'s
influence has grown in the Middle East based on a strategic depth
doctrine, also called
[Neo-Ottomanism](Neo-Ottomanism "wikilink").[^202][^203] ![Members and
observers of the [Organization of Turkic
States](Organization_of_Turkic_States "wikilink")](Organization_of_Turkic_States_(orthographic_projection).svg "Members and observers of the Organization of Turkic States")

Following the [Arab Spring](Arab_Spring "wikilink") in December 2010,
the choices made by the government for supporting certain political
opposition groups in the affected countries have led to tensions with
some Arab states, such as Turkey\'s neighbor Syria since the start of
the [Syrian civil war](Syrian_civil_war "wikilink"), and
[Egypt](Egypt "wikilink") after the [ousting of President Mohamed
Morsi](2013_Egyptian_coup_d'tat "wikilink").[^204][^205]
`{{As of|2022}}`{=mediawiki}, Turkey does not have an ambassador in
either Syria or Egypt,[^206] but relations with both countries have
started to
improve.[^207][^208][^209][^210][^211]`{{Excessive citations inline|date=November 2023}}`{=mediawiki}

Diplomatic relations with [Israel](IsraelTurkey_relations "wikilink")
were also severed after the [Gaza flotilla
raid](Gaza_flotilla_raid "wikilink") in 2010 but were normalized
following a deal in June 2016.[^212] These political rifts have left
Turkey with few allies in the [East Mediterranean](Levant "wikilink"),
where large natural gas fields have recently been
discovered.[^213][^214] There is a dispute over Turkey\'s [maritime
boundaries with Greece](Aegean_dispute "wikilink") and
[Cyprus](CyprusTurkey_maritime_zones_dispute "wikilink") and drilling
rights in the eastern Mediterranean.[^215][^216]

After the [rapprochement with
Russia](RussiaTurkey_relations#Normalisation_of_ties_and_beyond:_2016present "wikilink")
in 2016, Turkey revised its stance regarding the solution of the
conflict in Syria.[^217][^218][^219] In January 2018, the Turkish
military and the Turkish-backed forces, including the [Syrian National
Army](Syrian_National_Army "wikilink"),[^220] began an [operation in
Syria](Operation_Olive_Branch "wikilink") aimed at ousting U.S.-backed
[YPG](People's_Protection_Units "wikilink") (which Turkey considers to
be an offshoot of the outlawed [PKK](PKK "wikilink"))[^221][^222] from
the enclave of [Afrin](Afrin,_Syria "wikilink").[^223][^224]

the president. The president is responsible to the Parliament for
matters of national security and the adequate preparation of the armed
forces to defend the country. However, the authority to declare war and
to deploy the Turkish Armed Forces to foreign countries or to allow
foreign armed forces to be stationed in Turkey rests solely with the
Parliament.[^231]

The [Gendarmerie General Command](Turkish_Gendarmerie "wikilink") and

A total of 90 [B61 nuclear bombs](B61_nuclear_bomb "wikilink") are
hosted at the [Incirlik Air Base](Incirlik_Air_Base "wikilink"), 40 of
which are allocated for use by the Turkish Air Force in case of a
nuclear conflict, but their use requires the approval of NATO.[^254] The
Turkish Armed Forces have a relatively substantial military presence
abroad,[^255] with [military

2017](Feminist_protest_from_Turkey.jpg "Feminist demonstration in Kadky, Istanbul, on 29 July 2017")

The human rights record of Turkey has been the subject of much
controversy and international condemnation. Between 1959 and 2011 the
[European Court of Human
Rights](European_Court_of_Human_Rights "wikilink") made more than 2,400
judgements against Turkey for human rights violations on issues such as
[Kurdish rights](Human_rights_of_Kurdish_people_in_Turkey "wikilink"),
[women\'s rights](women_in_Turkey "wikilink"), [LGBT
rights](LGBT_rights_in_Turkey "wikilink"), and [media
freedom](Mass_media_in_Turkey "wikilink").[^265][^266] Turkey\'s human
rights record continues to be a significant obstacle to the country\'s
membership of the EU.[^267]

In the latter half of the 1970s, Turkey suffered from [political
violence](political_violence_in_Turkey_(19761980) "wikilink") between
far-left and far-right militant groups, which culminated in the
[military coup of 1980](1980_Turkish_coup_d'tat "wikilink").[^268] The
[Kurdistan Workers\' Party](Kurdistan_Workers'_Party "wikilink") (PKK,
designated a [terrorist
organization](list_of_designated_terrorist_groups "wikilink") by Turkey,
the United States,[^269] and the European Union[^270]) was founded in
1978 by a group of Kurdish militants led by [Abdullah
calan](Abdullah_calan "wikilink"), seeking the foundation of an
independent Kurdish state based on
[Marxist--Leninist](socialist_state "wikilink") ideology.[^271] The
initial reason given by the PKK for this was the oppression of Kurds in
Turkey.[^272][^273] [A full-scale
insurgency](KurdishTurkish_conflict_(1978present) "wikilink") began
[in 1984](1984_PKK_attacks "wikilink"), when the PKK announced a Kurdish
uprising. With time the PKK modified its demands into equal rights for
ethnic Kurds and provincial autonomy within
Turkey.[^274][^275][^276][^277] Since 1980, the Turkish parliament
stripped its members of [immunity](Parliamentary_immunity "wikilink")
from prosecution, including 44 deputies most of which from the
pro-Kurdish parties.[^278]

In 2013, [widespread protests](Gezi_Park_protests "wikilink") erupted,
sparked by a plan to demolish [Gezi Park](Taksim_Gezi_Park "wikilink")
but soon growing into general anti-government dissent.[^279] On 20 May
2016, the Turkish parliament stripped almost a quarter of its members of
immunity from prosecution, including 101 deputies from the pro-Kurdish
[HDP](Peoples'_Democratic_Party_(Turkey) "wikilink") and the main
opposition [CHP](Republican_People's_Party "wikilink")
party.[^280][^281] By 2020, under the pretext of responding to a failed
coup attempt in 2016,[^282][^283] authorities had arrested or imprisoned
more than 90,000 Turkish citizens.[^284] According to the [Committee to
Protect Journalists](Committee_to_Protect_Journalists "wikilink"), the
[AKP](Justice_and_Development_Party_(Turkey) "wikilink") government has
waged crackdowns on [media
freedom](Censorship_in_Turkey "wikilink").[^285][^286] Many [journalists
have been arrested](List_of_arrested_journalists_in_Turkey "wikilink")
using charges of \"terrorism\" and \"anti-state
activities\".[^287][^288] In 2020, the CPJ identified 18 jailed
journalists in Turkey (including the editorial staff of
`{{Lang|tr|[[Cumhuriyet]]}}`{=mediawiki}, Turkey\'s oldest newspaper
still in circulation).[^289]

### LGBT rights {#lgbt_rights}

{{Main article|LGBT rights in Turkey}}
```
![[Istanbul Pride](Istanbul_Pride "wikilink") was organized in 2003 for
the first time. Since 2015, parades in [Istanbul](Istanbul "wikilink")
have been denied permission by the
government.[^290]](Gay_pride_Istanbul_2013_-_Taksim_Square.jpg "Istanbul Pride was organized in 2003 for the first time. Since 2015, parades in Istanbul have been denied permission by the government.")

Homosexual activity has been decriminalized in Turkey since
[1858](Tanzimat#Reforms "wikilink").[^292] LGBT people have had the
right to seek asylum in Turkey under the [Geneva
Convention](Convention_Relating_to_the_Status_of_Refugees "wikilink")
since 1951.[^293] However, LGBT people in Turkey face discrimination,
harassment and even violence.[^294] The Turkish authorities have carried
out many discriminatory practices.[^295][^296][^297] Despite these, LGBT
acceptance in Turkey is growing. In a survey conducted in 2016, 33% of
respondents said that LGBT people should have equal rights, which
increased to 45% in 2020. Another survey in 2018 found that the
proportion of people who would not want a homosexual neighbor decreased
from 55% in 2018 to 47% in 2019.[^298][^299] A 2015 poll found that 27%
of the Turkish public was in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage and
19% supported [civil unions](civil_unions "wikilink") instead.[^300]

When the annual [Istanbul Pride](Istanbul_Pride "wikilink") was
inaugurated in 2003, Turkey became the first Muslim-majority country to
hold a gay pride march.[^301] Since 2015, parades at [Taksim
Square](Taksim_Square "wikilink") and [stiklal
Avenue](stiklal_Avenue "wikilink") (where the Gezi Park protests took
place) have been denied government permission, citing security concerns,
but hundreds of people have defied the ban each year.[^302] Critics have
claimed that the bans were in fact
[ideological](political_Islam "wikilink").[^303]

Turkey bridges [Southeastern Europe](Southeastern_Europe "wikilink") and
[Western Asia](Western_Asia "wikilink"). Asian Turkey, which includes
97% of the country\'s territory, is separated from [European
Turkey](East_Thrace "wikilink") by the
[Bosphorus](Bosphorus "wikilink"), the [Sea of
Marmara](Sea_of_Marmara "wikilink"), and the
[Dardanelles](Dardanelles "wikilink"). European Turkey comprises 3% of
the country\'s territory.[^304] Turkey covers an area of
`{{convert|783562|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}}`{=mediawiki},[^305] of which
`{{convert|755688|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}}`{=mediawiki} is in Asia and
`{{convert|23764|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}}`{=mediawiki} is in Europe.[^306]
The country is encircled by seas on three sides: the [Aegean
Sea](Aegean_Sea "wikilink") to the west, the [Black
Sea](Black_Sea "wikilink") to the north and the [Mediterranean
Sea](Mediterranean_Sea "wikilink") to the south. Turkey also contains
the Sea of Marmara in the northwest.[^307] The [geographical centre of

[Marmara](Marmara_Region "wikilink"),
[Aegean](Aegean_Region "wikilink"), [Black
Sea](Black_Sea_Region "wikilink"), [Central
Anatolia](Central_Anatolia_Region "wikilink"), [Eastern
Anatolia](Eastern_Anatolia_Region "wikilink"), [Southeastern
Anatolia](Southeastern_Anatolia_Region "wikilink") and the
[Mediterranean](Mediterranean_Region,_Turkey "wikilink"). The uneven
north Anatolian terrain running along the Black Sea resembles a long,
narrow belt. This region comprises approximately one-sixth of Turkey\'s
total land area. As a general trend, the inland [Anatolian
Plateau](Anatolian_Plateau "wikilink") becomes increasingly rugged as it
progresses eastward.[^309] [Pamukkale](Pamukkale "wikilink") terraces
are made of [travertine](travertine "wikilink"), a sedimentary rock
deposited by mineral water from [hot springs](hot_springs "wikilink").
The area is famous for a carbonate mineral left by the flowing of
thermal spring water.[^310][^311] It was added as a [UNESCO World
Heritage Site](List_of_World_Heritage_Sites_in_Turkey "wikilink") in
1988 along with [Hierapolis](Hierapolis "wikilink").

[East Thrace](East_Thrace "wikilink"), the European portion of Turkey,
is located at the easternmost edge of the [Balkans](Balkans "wikilink").
It forms the border between Turkey and its neighbors Greece and
Bulgaria. The Asian part of the country mostly consists of the peninsula
of [Anatolia](Anatolia "wikilink"), which consists of a high central
plateau with narrow coastal plains, between the
[Krolu](Krolu_Mountains "wikilink") and
[Pontic](Pontic_Mountains "wikilink") mountain ranges to the north and
the [Taurus Mountains](Taurus_Mountains "wikilink") to the south. Most
of Turkey is vulnerable to
[earthquakes](List_of_earthquakes_in_Turkey "wikilink").[^312]

The [Eastern Anatolia Region](Eastern_Anatolia_Region "wikilink") mostly
corresponds to the western part of the [Armenian
highlands](Armenian_highlands "wikilink") (the plateau situated between
the Anatolian Plateau in the west and the [Lesser
Caucasus](Lesser_Caucasus "wikilink") in the north)[^313] and contains
[Mount Ararat](Mount_Ararat "wikilink"), Turkey\'s highest point at
`{{convert|5137|m|ft|abbr=off}}`{=mediawiki},[^314] and [Lake
Van](Lake_Van "wikilink"), the largest lake in the country.[^315]
Eastern Turkey has a mountainous landscape and is home to the sources of
rivers such as the [Euphrates](Euphrates "wikilink"),
[Tigris](Tigris "wikilink") and [Aras](Aras_River "wikilink"). The
[Southeastern Anatolia Region](Southeastern_Anatolia_Region "wikilink")
includes the northern plains of [Upper
Mesopotamia](Upper_Mesopotamia "wikilink").

The [Lakes Region](Turkish_Lakes_Region "wikilink") contains some of the
largest lakes in Turkey, such as [Lake
Beyehir](Lake_Beyehir "wikilink"), [Lake
Eirdir](Lake_Eirdir "wikilink"), [Lake
Burdur](Lake_Burdur "wikilink"), [Lake
Akehir](Lake_Akehir "wikilink"), [Lake Eber](Lake_Eber "wikilink") and
[Lake Ikl](Lake_Ikl "wikilink"). [Lake Tuz](Lake_Tuz "wikilink"),
[Lake Akdoan](Lake_Akdoan "wikilink"), [Lake
Nemrut](Lake_Nemrut "wikilink"), [Lake ldr](Lake_ldr "wikilink"),
[Lake znik](Lake_znik "wikilink"), [Lake
Uluabat](Lake_Uluabat "wikilink"), [Lake

Sapanca](Lake_Sapanca "wikilink"), [Lake Salda](Lake_Salda "wikilink"),
[Lake Meke](Lake_Meke "wikilink") and [Lake Uzungl](Uzungl "wikilink")
are among other renowned lakes in Turkey. The rocks along the shoreline
of Lake Salda were formed over time by microbes;[^316][^317] these
so-called [microbialites](microbialite "wikilink") provide some of the
oldest known fossilized records of life.[^318][^319] Studying these
microbial fossils from Lake Salda has helped scientists prepare for
[NASA](NASA "wikilink")\'s [Mars 2020](Mars_2020 "wikilink")
mission.[^320][^321] In 2021, NASA reported that its Mars
surface-exploring rover Perseverance showed that \"the minerals and rock
deposits at Lake Salda are the nearest match on Earth to those around
the [Jezero Crater](Jezero_(crater) "wikilink") where the spacecraft
landed.\"[^322]

Turkey\'s position at the crossroads of the land, sea and air routes
between the three [Old World](Old_World "wikilink") continents and the
variety of the habitats across its geographical regions have produced
considerable species diversity and a vibrant ecosystem.[^323] Anatolia
is the homeland of many plants that have been cultivated for food, and
the wild ancestors of many plants that now provide staples for humankind
still grow in Turkey. The diversity of fauna is even greater than that
of its flora. The number of animal species in the whole of Europe is
around 60,000, while in Turkey there are over 80,000 animal
species.[^324]

The [Northern Anatolian conifer and deciduous
forests](Northern_Anatolian_conifer_and_deciduous_forests "wikilink") is
an [ecoregion](ecoregion "wikilink") which covers most of the Pontic
Mountains in northern Turkey, while the [Caucasus mixed
forests](Caucasus_mixed_forests "wikilink") extend across the eastern
end of the range. The region is home to Eurasian wildlife such as the
[Eurasian sparrowhawk](Eurasian_sparrowhawk "wikilink"), [golden

serin](red-fronted_serin "wikilink"), and
[wallcreeper](wallcreeper "wikilink").[^325] The narrow coastal strip
between the Pontic Mountains and the Black Sea is home to the
[Euxine-Colchic deciduous
forests](Euxine-Colchic_deciduous_forests "wikilink"), which contain
some of the world\'s few [temperate
rainforests](temperate_rainforest "wikilink").[^326] The [Turkish pine
(*Pinus brutia*)](Pinus_brutia "wikilink") is mostly found in Turkey and
other east Mediterranean countries. The [forests of
Turkey](Forest_in_Turkey "wikilink") are home to the [Turkey
oak](Quercus_cerris "wikilink"). The most commonly found species of the
genus [*Platanus* (plane)](Platanus "wikilink") is the
*[orientalis](Platanus_orientalis "wikilink")*. Several wild species of
[tulip](tulip "wikilink") are native to Anatolia, and the flower was
first [introduced to Western
Europe](Tulip#Introduction_to_Western_Europe "wikilink") with species
taken from the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century.[^327][^328] ![A white

[caracal](caracal "wikilink") are other [felid](Felidae "wikilink")
species which are found in the forests of Turkey. The [Caspian
tiger](Caspian_tiger "wikilink"), now extinct, lived in the easternmost
regions of Turkey until the latter half of the 20th century.[^333][^334]
Renowned domestic animals from Ankara include the [Angora

### Climate

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Climate of Turkey}}
```
[upright=1.3\|thumb\|[Kppen climate
types](Kppen_climate_classification_system "wikilink") of
Turkey[^336]](File:Koppen-Geiger_Map_TUR_present.svg "wikilink") The
coastal areas of Turkey bordering the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas have
a [temperate](temperate "wikilink") [Mediterranean
climate](Mediterranean_climate "wikilink"), with hot, dry summers and
mild to cool, wet winters.[^337] The coastal areas bordering the Black
Sea have a temperate [oceanic climate](oceanic_climate "wikilink") with
warm, wet summers and cool to cold, wet winters.[^338] The Turkish Black
Sea coast receives the most precipitation and is the only region of
Turkey that receives high precipitation throughout the year.[^339] The
eastern part of the Black Sea coast averages
`{{convert|2200|mm|in}}`{=mediawiki} annually which is the highest
precipitation in the country.[^340] The coastal areas bordering the Sea
of Marmara, which connects the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea, have a
transitional climate between a temperate Mediterranean climate and a
temperate oceanic climate with warm to hot, moderately dry summers and
cool to cold, wet winters.[^341]

Snow falls on the coastal areas of the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea
almost every winter but usually melts in no more than a few days.[^342]
However, snow is rare in the coastal areas of the Aegean Sea and very
rare in the coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea.[^343] Winters on the
Anatolian plateau are especially severe. Temperatures of
`{{convert|-30|to|-40|C|F}}`{=mediawiki} do occur in northeastern
Anatolia, and snow may lie on the ground for at least 120 days of the
year, and during the entire year on the summits of the highest
mountains. In central Anatolia the temperatures can drop below
`{{convert|-20|C|F|abbr=on}}`{=mediawiki} with the mountains being
even colder. Mountains close to the coast prevent Mediterranean
influences from extending inland, giving the central Anatolian Plateau a
[continental climate](continental_climate "wikilink") with sharply
contrasting seasons.[^344]

Because of a combination of socioeconomic, population exposure, and
climate factors, Turkey is highly
[vulnerable](Climate_change_vulnerability "wikilink") to [climate
change](climate_change "wikilink").[^345]

## Economy

![Turkey is expected to have fast economic growth due to demographics
and rapid urbanization. The following table is from the OECD Long Term
Projections.](Gdp_future_forecast_PPP.png "Turkey is expected to have fast economic growth due to demographics and rapid urbanization. The following table is from the OECD Long Term Projections.")
Turkey is a founding member of the OECD and [G20](G20 "wikilink"), and
is classified among the E7 countries and EAGLEs. It is a [newly
industrialized country](newly_industrialized_country "wikilink") with an
upper-middle income economy, which is the [17th-largest in the
world](List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal) "wikilink") by nominal GDP,
and the [11th-largest](List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP) "wikilink") by
[PPP](purchasing_power_parity "wikilink"). According to
[IMF](International_Monetary_Fund "wikilink") estimates, Turkey\'s GDP
per capita by PPP is \$41,412 in 2023, while its nominal GDP per capita
is \$11,932.[^346] Approximately 11.7% of Turks were at risk of poverty
or social exclusion as of 2019.[^347] Unemployment in Turkey was 12% in
2021.[^348] According to the World Bank, the middle class population in
Turkey rose from 18% to 41% of the total population between 1993 and
2010.[^349]

direct investment](Foreign_direct_investment "wikilink") in Turkey
peaked at \$22.05 billion in 2007 and dropped to \$13.22 billion in
2021.[^362]

The [automotive industry in
Turkey](automotive_industry_in_Turkey "wikilink") is sizeable, and
produced 1,352,648 motor vehicles in 2022, ranking as the [13th largest
producer in the
world](List_of_countries_by_motor_vehicle_production "wikilink").[^363]
Turkish automotive companies like [TEMSA](TEMSA "wikilink"),
[Otokar](Otokar "wikilink") and [BMC](BMC_(Turkey) "wikilink") are among
the world\'s largest van, bus and truck manufacturers.
[Togg](Togg "wikilink"), or Turkey\'s Automobile Joint Venture Group
Inc., is the first all-electric vehicle company of Turkey. Turkish
[shipyards](shipyard "wikilink") are highly regarded both for the
production of chemical and [oil tankers](oil_tanker "wikilink") up to
10,000 [dwt](Deadweight_tonnage "wikilink") and also for their [mega
yachts](mega_yacht "wikilink").[^364] Turkish brands like
[Beko](Beko "wikilink") and [Vestel](Vestel "wikilink") are among the
largest producers of consumer electronics and home appliances in Europe,
and invest a substantial amount of funds for research and development in
new technologies related to these fields.[^365][^366][^367]

Other key sectors of the Turkish economy are banking, construction, home
appliances, electronics, textiles, oil refining, petrochemical products,
food, mining, iron and steel, and machine industry. According to a
Turkish Statistical Institute survey in 2021, which used the available
data for 2020, it was estimated that 47% of total disposable income was
received by the top 20% of income earners, while the lowest 20% received
only 6%.[^368] [Subsidies](Subsidies "wikilink") which are harmful to
[health in Turkey](health_in_Turkey "wikilink") include those on
sugar[^369] and coal.[^370]

### Tourism

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Tourism in Turkey}}

Tourism has increased almost every year in the 21st century[^371] and is
an important part of the economy. The [Ministry of Culture and
Tourism](Ministry_of_Culture_and_Tourism_(Turkey) "wikilink") currently
promotes tourism under the project [Turkey
Home](Turkey_Home "wikilink"). Turkey is one of the world\'s top five
destination countries, with the highest percentage of foreign visitors
arriving from Europe; specially Germany and Russia in recent
years.[^372] In 2022, Turkey [ranked fourth in the
world](World_Tourism_rankings#Most_visited_destinations_by_international_tourist_arrivals "wikilink")
in terms of the number of international tourist arrivals with 50.5
million foreign tourists.[^373] Turkey has [21 UNESCO World Heritage
Sites](List_of_World_Heritage_Sites_in_Turkey "wikilink") and [84 World
Heritage Sites in tentative
list](List_of_World_Heritage_Sites_in_Turkey_(Tentative_list) "wikilink").
Turkey is home to 519 [Blue Flag beaches](Blue_Flag_beaches "wikilink"),
third most in the world.[^374] According to [Euromonitor
International](Euromonitor_International "wikilink") report, Istanbul is
the most visited city in the world, with more than 20.2 million foreign
visitors in 2023.[^375] Also Antalya has surpassed

[international airports](international_airport "wikilink").[^378]
[Istanbul Airport](Istanbul_Airport "wikilink") is planned to be the
largest airport in the world, with a capacity to serve 150 million
passengers per year.[^379][^380] [Turkish
Airlines](Turkish_Airlines "wikilink") uses Istanbul Airport, which has
a current annual capacity of serving 90 million passengers, as its main
hub and [several other airlines operate in the
country](List_of_airlines_of_Turkey "wikilink"). Turkish Airlines has
scheduled services to 315 destinations in 129 countries, making it the

[The motorway network](Otoyol "wikilink") spans 3,633 kilometres (2,257
mi) as of 2023,[^384] with an expected expansion to
`{{convert|9,312|km|mi|abbr=off}}`{=mediawiki} by 2035.[^385] [Istanbul
Metro](Istanbul_Metro "wikilink") is the largest metro network in the
country with 495 million annual ridership.[^386] Opened in 2013, the
[Marmaray tunnel](Marmaray "wikilink") under the Bosphorus connects the
railway and metro lines of Istanbul\'s European and Asian sides; while
the nearby [Eurasia Tunnel](Eurasia_Tunnel "wikilink") provides an
undersea road connection for motor vehicles.[^387]

[Russia](Energy_in_Russia "wikilink").[^392]
`{{As of|2018}}`{=mediawiki} Turkey consumes 1,700
[terawatt](terawatt "wikilink") hours of [primary
energy](primary_energy "wikilink") per year, a little over 20
[megawatt](megawatt "wikilink") hours per person, mostly from imported
[fossil fuels](fossil_fuels "wikilink").[^393] Although the energy
policy includes reducing fossil-fuel imports, [coal in
Turkey](coal_in_Turkey "wikilink") is the largest single reason why
[greenhouse gas emissions by
Turkey](greenhouse_gas_emissions_by_Turkey "wikilink") amount to 1% of
the global total. [Renewable energy in
Turkey](Renewable_energy_in_Turkey "wikilink") is being increased and
the [Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant](Akkuyu_Nuclear_Power_Plant "wikilink")
is being built on the Mediterranean coast. However, despite the
overcapacity in [national electricity
generation](Electricity_sector_in_Turkey "wikilink"), [fossil fuels are
still subsidized](Fossil_fuel_subsidies "wikilink").[^394] In 2019
Turkey had the [fourth-highest direct utilization and
capacity](Geothermal_power#Utility-grade_stations "wikilink") of
[geothermal power](Geothermal_energy_in_Turkey "wikilink") in the
world[^395] and produced 43.8% of its electricity from renewable
sources.[^396]

Many [natural gas](Gas_in_Turkey "wikilink") pipelines span the
country.[^397] [Blue Stream](Blue_Stream "wikilink"), a major
trans-Black Sea gas pipeline, delivers natural gas from Russia as does
the undersea pipeline [TurkStream](TurkStream "wikilink").[^398] The
[Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline](BakuTbilisiCeyhan_pipeline "wikilink")
is the second longest [oil pipeline](oil_pipeline "wikilink") in the
world.[^399] As of 2022, almost all gas is imported, but production from
the [Sakarya gas field](Sakarya_gas_field "wikilink"), a [sweet
gas](sweet_gas "wikilink") field in the Black Sea discovered by
[TPAO](TPAO "wikilink") in 2020,[^400] began in 2023,[^401] with an
estimated peak production of 40 bcm in 2026.[^402] As of 2022, the total
volume of natural gas discovered in the Black Sea amounted to 710

According to the *Address-Based Population Recording System*, the
country\'s population was 85,372,377 in 2023, excluding Syrians under
temporary protection.[^427] 93% lived in [province and district
centers](urban_area "wikilink").[^428] In 2023, Turkey had an average
[population density](population_density "wikilink") of 111 people per
km^2^.[^429] People within the 15--64 age group constituted 68.3% of the
total population; the 0--14 age group corresponded to 21.4%; while
senior citizens aged 65 years or older made up 10.2%.[^430] Between 1950
and 2020, Turkey\'s population more than quadrupled from 20.9 million to
83.6 million;[^431] however, the population growth rate was 0.1% in
2023.[^432]

![Percentage of Kurdish population in Turkey by
region[^433]](Kurdish_population_by_region_(KONDA_2010).png "Percentage of Kurdish population in Turkey by region")
Article 66 of the [Turkish
Constitution](Turkish_Constitution "wikilink") defines a \"Turk\" as
anyone who is a citizen; therefore, the legal use of the term
\"Turkish\" as a [citizen](citizenship "wikilink") is different from the
[ethnic](ethnic_group "wikilink") definition.[^435] However
approximately 70--80% of the country\'s citizens are ethnic
Turks.[^436][^437] It is estimated that there are at least 47 ethnic
groups represented in Turkey.[^438] Reliable data on the ethnic mix of
the population is not available because census figures do not include
statistics on ethnicity after the [1965 Turkish
census](1965_Turkish_census "wikilink").[^439]

According to the Constitutional Court, there are only four officially
recognized [minorities in Turkey](minorities_in_Turkey "wikilink"): the

[Kurds](Kurds_in_Turkey "wikilink") are the largest non-Turkish
ethnicity at 12--25% of the population.[^447][^448] The exact figure
remains a subject of dispute; according to Servet Mutlu, \"more often
than not, these estimates reflect pro-Kurdish or pro-Turkish sympathies
and attitudes rather than scientific facts or erudition\".[^449]
Mutlu\'s 1990 study estimated Kurds made up around 12% of the

cities in central and western Turkey. In Istanbul, there are an
estimated three million Kurds, making it the city with the largest
Kurdish population in the world.[^452] Non-Kurdish minorities are

### Immigration

{{Main|Immigration to Turkey}}
```
Excluding Syrians under temporary protection, there were 1,570,543
foreign citizens in Turkey in 2023.[^460] Millions of Kurds fled across
the mountains to Turkey and the Kurdish areas of Iran during the [Gulf
War](Gulf_War "wikilink") in 1991. [Turkey\'s migrant
crisis](Turkey's_migrant_crisis "wikilink") in the 2010s and early 2020s
resulted in the influx of millions of refugees and immigrants.[^461]
Turkey hosts the largest number of refugees in the world as of April
2020.[^462] The [Disaster and Emergency Management
Presidency](Disaster_and_Emergency_Management_Presidency "wikilink")
manages the refugee crisis in Turkey. Before the start of the [Syrian
civil war](Syrian_civil_war "wikilink") in 2011, the estimated number of
[Arabs in Turkey](Arabs_in_Turkey "wikilink") varied from 1 million to
more than 2 million.[^463]

In November 2020, there were 3.6 million [Syrian
refugees](Refugees_of_the_Syrian_civil_war_in_Turkey "wikilink") in
Turkey;[^464] these included other [ethnic groups of
Syria](ethnic_groups_of_Syria "wikilink"), such as [Syrian
Kurds](Syrian_Kurds "wikilink")[^465] and [Syrian
Turkmens](Syrian_Turkmen "wikilink").[^466] As of August 2023, the
number these refugees was estimated to be 3.3 million. The number of
Syrians had decreased by about 200,000 people since the beginning of the
year.[^467] The government has granted citizenship to 238 thousand
Syrians by November 2023.[^468] As of May 2023, approximately 96,000
Ukrainian [refugees of the 2022 Russian invasion of
Ukraine](Ukrainian_refugee_crisis_(2022present) "wikilink") have sought
refuge in Turkey.[^469] In 2022, nearly 100,000 Russian citizens
migrated to Turkey, becoming the first in the list of foreigners who
moved to Turkey, meaning an increase of more than 218% from 2021.[^470]

### Languages

The [official language](official_language "wikilink") is
[Turkish](Turkish_language "wikilink"), which is the most widely spoken
[Turkic language](Turkic_languages "wikilink") in the world.[^471][^472]
It is spoken by 86% of the population as a [first
language](first_language "wikilink").[^473] According to
*[Ethnologue](Ethnologue "wikilink")*, 11% of the population speaks the
[Kurmanji](Kurmanji "wikilink") dialect of
[Kurdish](Kurdish_languages "wikilink") as their mother tongue and,
because of the large number of [Syrians in
Turkey](Syrians_in_Turkey "wikilink"), 5% speak [Levantine
Arabic](Levantine_Arabic "wikilink").[^474]

```
![[Selimiye Mosque](Selimiye_Mosque,_Edirne "wikilink") was built by the
imperial architect [Mimar Sinan](Mimar_Sinan "wikilink").[^484] The
mosque was included on [UNESCO](UNESCO "wikilink")\'s [World Heritage

](Selimiye_Mosque,_Dome.jpg "Selimiye Mosque was built by the imperial architect Mimar Sinan. The mosque was included on UNESCO's World Heritage List in 2011. ")

Turkey is a [secular state](secular_state "wikilink") with no official
[state religion](state_religion "wikilink"); the constitution provides
for [freedom of religion](freedom_of_religion "wikilink") and
[conscience](Freedom_of_conscience "wikilink").[^488][^489] A 2016
survey by [Ipsos](Ipsos "wikilink"), interviewing 17,180 adults across
22 countries, found that [Islam](Islam "wikilink") was the dominant
religion in Turkey, adhered to by 82% of the total population;
religiously unaffiliated people comprised 13% of the population, while
[2% were Christians](Christianity_in_Turkey "wikilink").[^490] The level
of religiosity study by Konda found 9.7% of the population who are
\'fully devoted\', 52% who \'strives to fulfill religious obligations\',
34.3% who \'does not fulfill religious obligations\' and 3.2%
\'Nonbeliever/Irreligious\'.[^491][^492] Another poll conducted by
Gezici Aratrma in 2020 interviewed 1,062 people in 12 provinces and
found that 28.5% of the [Generation Z](Generation_Z "wikilink")
[identify as irreligious](Irreligion_in_Turkey "wikilink").[^493][^494]

According to a survey by the pollster
[KONDA](KONDA_Research_and_Consultancy "wikilink"), the percentage of
atheists in Turkey has tripled in 10 years and rose from 1% in 2008 to
3% in 2018, the percentage of non-believers or agnostics rose from 1% to
2%, and that 90% of irreligious Turks were under 35 years
old.[^495][^496][^497]

The *[CIA World Factbook](CIA_World_Factbook "wikilink")* reports that
Islam is the religion of 99.8% of the population, with
[Sunni](Sunni "wikilink") Muslims as the largest sect, while 0.2% are
Christians and Jews.[^498] However, there are no official governmental
statistics specifying the religious beliefs of the Turkish people, nor
is religious data recorded in the country\'s census.[^499] Academics
suggest the [Alevi](Alevi "wikilink") population may be from 15 to 20
million, while the Alevi-Bektai Federation states that there are around
25 million.[^500][^501] According to [Aksiyon](Aksiyon "wikilink")
magazine, the number of [Twelver](Twelver "wikilink")
[Shias](Shia_Islam "wikilink") (excluding Alevis) is three million
(4.2%).[^502]

The percentage of Christians in Turkey fell from 17.5% (three million
followers) in a population of 16 million to 2.5% in the early 20th
century.[^505] mainly as a result of the [Armenian
genocide](Armenian_genocide "wikilink"), the [population exchange
between Greece and
Turkey](population_exchange_between_Greece_and_Turkey "wikilink") and
the [emigration of Christians](Christian_emigration "wikilink") that
began in the late 19th century and gained pace in the first quarter of
the 20th
century.[^506][^507]`{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2023}}`{=mediawiki}
Today, there are more than 120,000--320,000 people of various [Christian
denominations](Christian_denominations "wikilink"),[^508] representing
less than 0.2% of Turkey\'s population,[^509] including an estimated
80,000 [Oriental Orthodox](Oriental_Orthodox "wikilink"), 35,000 [Roman
Catholics](Catholic_Church "wikilink"),[^510] 18,000 [Antiochian
Greeks](Antiochian_Greeks "wikilink"),[^511] 5,000 [Greek
Orthodox](Greek_Orthodox_Church "wikilink"), smaller numbers of
[Protestants](Protestantism "wikilink"),[^512] and 512
[Mormons](Mormons "wikilink").[^513] Currently, there are 398 churches
open for worship in Turkey.[^514]

Turkey has a small Jewish population;[^515] with around 26,000
[Jews](History_of_the_Jews_in_Turkey "wikilink"), the vast majority of
whom are [Sephardi](Sephardi_Jews "wikilink").[^516] Turkey has [the
largest Jewish community](Jewish_population_by_country "wikilink") among
the Muslim-majority countries.[^517][^518]

In a mid-2010s poll, 2.9% of Turkish respondents identified as
atheists.[^519] The [Association of
Atheism](Atheism_Association_(Turkey) "wikilink"), the first official
atheist organization in the Balkans and the Middle East, was founded in
2014.[^520][^521] Some religious and secular officials have claimed that
[atheism](atheism "wikilink") and [deism](deism "wikilink") are growing
among Turkish people.[^522][^523][^524][^525]

### Education

![[Istanbul University](Istanbul_University "wikilink") (1453) was
founded by sultan [Mehmed II](Mehmed_II "wikilink") as a
*[Darlfnn](Institute_of_technology "wikilink")*. On 1 August 1933, as
part of [Atatrk\'s reforms](Atatrk's_reforms "wikilink"), it was
reorganized and became the Republic\'s first modern
university.[^526]](stanbulUniversityGate2.jpg "Istanbul University (1453) was founded by sultan Mehmed II as a Darlfnn. On 1 August 1933, as part of Atatrk's reforms, it was reorganized and became the Republic's first modern university.")
![[Galatasaray University](Galatasaray_University "wikilink") is one of
the best universities in
Europe.](Galatasaray_University_seen_from_the_sea.JPG "Galatasaray University is one of the best universities in Europe.")

The [Ministry of National
Education](Ministry_of_National_Education_(Turkey) "wikilink") is
responsible for pre-tertiary education.[^528] This is compulsory and
lasts twelve years: four years each for primary school, middle school
and high school.[^529] All 12 years of compulsory education is free of
charge in public schools.[^530] Basic education is said to lag behind
other OECD countries, with significant differences between high and low
performers.[^531] Access to a high-quality school heavily depends on the
performance in the secondary school entrance exams, to the point that
some students begin taking private tutoring classes when they are ten
years old.[^532]

There are 209 [universities in
Turkey](List_of_universities_in_Turkey "wikilink").[^533] Except for the
Open Education Faculties at [Anadolu](Anadolu_University "wikilink"),
[Istanbul](Istanbul_University "wikilink") and
[Atatrk](Atatrk_University "wikilink") universities, entrance is
regulated by the national [Student Selection and Placement
System](Student_Selection_and_Placement_System "wikilink")
(`{{lang-tr|renci Seme ve Yerletirme Sistemi}}`{=mediawiki}, SYS)
examination, after which high school graduates are assigned to
universities according to their performance.[^534] According to the
2012--2013 [Times Higher Education World University
Rankings](Times_Higher_Education_World_University_Rankings "wikilink"),
the top university was the [Middle East Technical
University](Middle_East_Technical_University "wikilink"), followed by
[Bilkent University](Bilkent_University "wikilink"), [Ko
University](Ko_University "wikilink"), [Istanbul Technical
University](Istanbul_Technical_University "wikilink") and [Boazii

universities are under the control of the [Higher Education
Board](Council_of_Higher_Education_(Turkey) "wikilink")
(`{{lang-tr|Yksekretim Kurulu}}`{=mediawiki}, YK). Since 2016, the
president of Turkey directly appoints all rectors of all state and
private universities.[^536]

Turkey is a member of the [Socrates
programme](Socrates_programme "wikilink"), [Erasmus
Programme](Erasmus_Programme "wikilink") and
[Erasmus+](Erasmus+ "wikilink") Programmes.[^537] Turkey is also a
member of the [Erasmus Student
Network](Erasmus_Student_Network "wikilink"), a student organization
with more than 15,000 volunteers across Europe.[^538] Turkey has become
a hub for foreign students in recent years, with 795,962 foreign
students in 2016.[^539] The government has announced a plan to draw
around 500,000 foreign students at its universities by offering
attractive scholarships.[^540] In 2021 [Trkiye
Scholarships](Trkiye_Scholarships "wikilink"), a government-funded
program, received 165,000 applications from prospective students in 178
countries.[^541][^542][^543]

### Health

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Health care in Turkey}}
```
![[Acbadem
Hospital](Acbadem_Healthcare_Group "wikilink")](AcbademHospitalAltunizade_(1).jpg "Acbadem Hospital")

The [Ministry of Health](Ministry_of_Health_(Turkey) "wikilink") has run
a universal public healthcare system since 2003.[^544] Known as
Universal Health Insurance
(`{{lang|tr|Genel Salk Sigortas}}`{=mediawiki}), it is funded by a
tax surcharge on employers, currently at 5%.[^545] Public-sector funding
covers approximately 75.2% of health expenditures.[^546] Despite the
universal health care, total expenditure on health as a share of GDP in
2018 was the lowest among OECD countries at 6.3% of GDP, compared to the
OECD average of 9.3%.[^547] The lower health care expenditure is due to
lower median age in Turkey which is 32.4, compared to Italy which is
47.3.[^548] Aging population is the prime reason for higher healthcare
expenditure in the developed world.[^549]

Average life expectancy is 78.6 years (75.9 for males and 81.3 for
females), compared with the EU average of 81 years.[^550] Turkey has
high rates of [obesity](obesity "wikilink"), with 29.5% of its adult
population having a [body mass index](body_mass_index "wikilink") (BMI)
value of 30 or above.[^551] [Air pollution is a major
cause](Air_pollution_in_Turkey "wikilink") of early death.[^552]

There are many private hospitals in the country. Medical tourism
generated revenues of more than \$1 billion in 2019.[^553] Around 60% of
the income has been obtained from plastic surgery and a total of 662,087
patients received service in the country within the scope of health
tourism in 2019.[^554]

![Taksim Square entrance of [stiklal

Turkey has a very diverse culture that is a blend of various elements of
the [Turkic](Turkic_peoples "wikilink"),
[Anatolian](Anatolia "wikilink"),
[Byzantine](Byzantine_culture "wikilink") and
[Ottoman](Culture_of_the_Ottoman_Empire "wikilink") cultures (the latter
was in many aspects a continuation of both the
[Greco-Roman](Greco-Roman "wikilink") and
[Islamic](Islamic_culture "wikilink") cultures) with [Western
culture](Western_culture "wikilink") and traditions, a process that
started with the [Westernization of the Ottoman
Empire](Tanzimat "wikilink") and still continues today.[^555][^556] This
mix originally began as a result of the encounter of the Turks and their
culture with those of the peoples they came across during [their
migration](Turkic_migration "wikilink") from Central Asia to the
West.[^557][^558] Contemporary Turkish culture during the republican
period is a product of efforts to create a \"modern\" Western society,
while maintaining traditional, religious and historical values.[^559]
The culture has influenced European art and fashion, particularly
between the 16th and 18th centuries, during the peak of Ottoman power --
a phenomenon that was called *[Turquerie](Turquerie "wikilink")*.

### Visual arts {#visual_arts}

```{=mediawiki}
{{further|History of Modern Turkish painting|znik pottery|3=Turkish illumination}}
```
[Ottoman miniature](Ottoman_miniature "wikilink") is linked to the
[Persian miniature](Persian_miniature "wikilink") tradition and is
likewise influenced by [Chinese
painting](Chinese_painting#Late_imperial_China_(13681895) "wikilink")
styles and techniques. The words *tasvir* or *nak* were used to define
the art of miniature painting in Ottoman Turkish. The studios the
artists worked in were called *nakkahane*.[^560] The understanding of
[perspective](Perspective_(graphical) "wikilink") was different from
that of the nearby European Renaissance painting tradition, and the
scene depicted often included different time periods and spaces in one
picture. They followed closely the context of the book they were
included in, more illustrations than standalone works of art.[^561]
Sixteenth-century artists [Nakka Osman](Nakka_Osman "wikilink") and
[Matrak Nasuh](Matrak_Nasuh "wikilink") are among the most prominent
artists of this era.

[Turkish painting](History_of_Modern_Turkish_painting "wikilink"), in
the Western sense, developed actively starting from the mid 19th
century. The first painting lessons were scheduled at what is now the
[Istanbul Technical
University](Istanbul_Technical_University "wikilink") (then the
*Imperial Military Engineering School*) in 1793, mostly for technical
purposes.[^562] In the late 19th century, human figure in the Western
sense was being established in Turkish painting, especially with [Osman
Hamdi Bey](Osman_Hamdi_Bey "wikilink").
[Impressionism](Impressionism "wikilink"), among the contemporary
trends, appeared later on with [Halil
Pasha](Halil_Pasha_(painter) "wikilink"). Other important Turkish
painters in the 19th century were [Ferik brahim
Paa](Ferik_brahim_Pasha "wikilink"), [Osman Nuri
Paa](Osman_Nuri_Pasha_(painter) "wikilink"), [eker Ahmet
Paa](eker_Ahmet_Paa "wikilink"), and [Hoca Ali
Riza](Hoca_Ali_Riza "wikilink").[^563]

![[znik tiles](znik_tiles "wikilink") and [Ktahya
tiles](Iznik_pottery#znik_and_Ktahya "wikilink") were used for the
interior decorations in [Ottoman
architecture](Ottoman_architecture "wikilink").
[Turquoise](Turquoise_(color) "wikilink") (meaning \"Turkish\" in
French) and various [shades of blue](shades_of_blue "wikilink") were the
most commonly used colors in Ottoman
tiles.](Topkapi_circumcision_room_tiles_DSCF2278.jpg "znik tiles and Ktahya tiles were used for the interior decorations in Ottoman architecture. Turquoise (meaning "Turkish" in French) and various shades of blue were the most commonly used colors in Ottoman tiles.")

[Carpet (*hal*)](Anatolian_rug "wikilink") and tapestry
(*[kilim](kilim "wikilink")*) weaving is a traditional Turkish art form
with roots in pre-Islamic times. During its long history, the art and
craft of weaving carpets and tapestries in Turkey has integrated
numerous cultural traditions. Apart from the Turkic design patterns that
are prevalent, traces of [Persian](Persian_carpet "wikilink") and
[Byzantine](Byzantine_silk#Tapestry_and_embroidery "wikilink") patterns
can also be detected. There are also similarities with the patterns used
in Armenian, Caucasian and Kurdish carpet designs. The arrival of Islam
in Central Asia and the development of [Islamic
art](Islamic_art "wikilink") also influenced Turkic patterns in the
medieval period. The history of the designs, motifs and ornaments used
in Turkish carpets and tapestries thus reflects the political and ethnic
history of the Turks and the cultural diversity of Anatolia. However,
scientific attempts were unsuccessful, as yet, to attribute a particular
design to a specific ethnic, regional, or even nomadic versus village
tradition.[^564]

The earliest examples of [paper marbling](paper_marbling "wikilink"),
called *[ebru](Paper_marbling "wikilink")* in Turkish, are said to be a
copy of the *Hlnme* by the poet Arif. The text of this manuscript was
rendered in a delicate cut paper dcoupage calligraphy by Mehmed bin
Gazanfer and completed in 1540, and features many marbled and decorative
paper borders. One early master by the [pseudonym](pseudonym "wikilink")
of *ebek* is mentioned posthumously in the earliest Ottoman text on the
art known as the *Tertib-i Risle-i Ebr*, which is dated based on
internal evidence to after 1615. The instructions for several *ebru*
techniques in the text are accredited to this master. [Hatip Mehmed
Efendi](Hatip_Mehmed_Efendi "wikilink") is accredited with developing
motifs and perhaps early floral designs, although evidence from India
appears to contradict some of these reports. Despite this, marbled
motifs are commonly referred to as *hatip* designs in Turkey
today.[^565]

Interaction between the Ottoman Empire and the Islamic world along with
Europe contributed to a blend of Turkic, Islamic and European traditions
in modern-day Turkish music and literary arts.[^566] [Turkish
literature](Turkish_literature "wikilink") was heavily influenced by
[Persian](Persian_literature "wikilink") and [Arabic
literature](Arabic_literature "wikilink") during most of the Ottoman
era.`{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}`{=mediawiki} The Tanzimat
reforms of the 19th century introduced previously unknown Western
genres, primarily the [novel](novel "wikilink") and the [short
story](short_story "wikilink"). Many of the writers in the Tanzimat
period wrote in several genres simultaneously: for instance, the poet
[Namk Kemal](Namk_Kemal "wikilink") also wrote the 1876 novel
*ntibh* (Awakening), while the journalist
[inasi](brahim_inasi "wikilink") has written, in 1860, the first
modern Turkish play, the [one-act](One_act_play "wikilink") comedy
\"*air Evlenmesi*\" (The Poet\'s Marriage). Most of the roots of modern
Turkish literature were formed between 1896 and
1923.`{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}`{=mediawiki}

The first radical step of innovation in 20th century Turkish poetry was
taken by [Nzm Hikmet](Nzm_Hikmet_Ran "wikilink"), who introduced the
[free verse](free_verse "wikilink") style. Another revolution in Turkish
poetry came about in 1941 with the [Garip](Garip "wikilink") movement
led by [Orhan Veli](Orhan_Veli_Kank "wikilink"), [Oktay
Rfat](Oktay_Rfat_Horozcu "wikilink") and [Melih
Cevdet](Melih_Cevdet_Anday "wikilink").

The mix of cultural influences in Turkey is dramatized, for example, in
the form of the \"new symbols of the clash and interlacing of cultures\"
enacted in the novels of [Orhan Pamuk](Orhan_Pamuk "wikilink"),
recipient of the 2006 [Nobel Prize in
Literature](Nobel_Prize_in_Literature "wikilink").[^567]

The origin of [Turkish theater](Theatre_of_Turkey "wikilink") dates back
to ancient pagan rituals and oral legends.[^568] The dances, music and
songs performed during the rituals of the inhabitants of Anatolia
millennia ago are the elements from which the first shows originated. In
time, the ancient rituals, myths, legends and stories evolved into
theatrical shows. Starting from the 11th-century, the traditions of the
Seljuk Turks blended with those of the indigenous peoples of Anatolia
and the interaction between diverse cultures paved the way for new
plays.[^569][^570] [Meddah](Meddah "wikilink") were
[storytellers](storytelling "wikilink") who performed in front of
audiences during the Ottoman period.[^571] [Karagz and
Hacivat](Karagz_and_Hacivat "wikilink") are the lead characters of the
traditional Turkish [shadow play](shadow_play "wikilink"), popularized
during the Ottoman period and then spread to most ethnic groups of the
Ottoman Empire.

After the Tanzimat period, characters in Turkish theatre were modernized
and plays were performed on European-style stages, with actors wearing
European costumes. Following the [restoration of constitutional
monarchy](Second_Constitutional_Era "wikilink") with the [Young Turk
Revolution](Young_Turk_Revolution "wikilink") in 1908, theatrical
activities increased and social problems began to be reflected at the
theatre as well as in historical plays. A theatrical conservatoire,
[Darlbedayi-i Osmani](Darlbedayi "wikilink") (which became the nucleus
of the [Istanbul City Theatres](Istanbul_City_Theatres "wikilink")) was
established in 1914. Numerous Turkish playwrights emerged in this era,
and the first Turkish musicals were also written. In time, Turkish women
began to appear on stage; until then, female roles had only been played
by actresses who were members of Turkey\'s ethnic minorities. Today
there are numerous private theatres in the country, together with those
which are subsidized by the government, such as the [Turkish State
Theatres](Turkish_State_Theatres "wikilink").[^572]

```
The roots of traditional music in Turkey span across centuries to a time
when the Seljuk Turks migrated to Anatolia and Persia in the 11th
century and contains elements of both Turkic and pre-Turkic influences.
Much of its modern popular music can trace its roots to the emergence in
the early 1930s drive for Westernization.[^573]

With the assimilation of immigrants from various regions the diversity
of musical genres and musical instrumentation also expanded. Turkey has
also seen documented folk music and recorded popular music produced in
the ethnic styles of [Greek](Music_of_Greece "wikilink"),
[Armenian](Music_of_Armenia "wikilink"),
[Albanian](Music_of_Albania "wikilink"),
[Polish](Music_of_Poland "wikilink") and [Jewish](Jewish "wikilink")
communities, among others.[^574]

Many Turkish cities and towns have vibrant local music scenes which, in
turn, support a number of regional musical styles. Despite this however,
western music styles like [pop music](pop_music "wikilink") and
[kanto](Kanto_(music) "wikilink") lost popularity to
[arabesque](Arabesque_(Turkish_music) "wikilink") in the late 1970s and
1980s. It became popular again by the beginning of the 1990s, as a
result of an opening economy and society. The resurging popularity of
pop music gave rise to several international Turkish pop stars such as
[Ajda Pekkan](Ajda_Pekkan "wikilink"), [Sezen
Aksu](Sezen_Aksu "wikilink"), [Erol Evgin](Erol_Evgin "wikilink"),
[MF](MF "wikilink"), [Tarkan](Tarkan_(singer) "wikilink"), [Sertab
Erener](Sertab_Erener "wikilink"), [Teoman](Teoman_(singer) "wikilink"),
[Kenan Doulu](Kenan_Doulu "wikilink"), [Levent
Yksel](Levent_Yksel "wikilink") and [Hande
Yener](Hande_Yener "wikilink"). Internationally acclaimed Turkish
[jazz](jazz "wikilink") and [blues](blues "wikilink") musicians and
composers include [Ahmet Ertegun](Ahmet_Ertegun "wikilink") (founder and
president of [Atlantic Records](Atlantic_Records "wikilink")), [Nkhet
Ruacan](Nkhet_Ruacan "wikilink") and Kerem Grsev.

The Byzantine era is usually dated from 330 AD at the founding of
Constantinople until the fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1453. Its
architecture dramatically influenced the later medieval architecture
throughout Europe and the [Near East](Near_East "wikilink") and became
the primary progenitor of the
[Renaissance](Renaissance_architecture "wikilink") and
[Ottoman](Renaissance_architecture "wikilink") architectural traditions
that followed its collapse.[^575] When the Roman Empire went Christian
(as well as eastwards) with Constantinople as its new capital, its
architecture became more sensuous and more ambitious. This new style,
which would come to be known as [Byzantine
architecture](Byzantine_architecture "wikilink"), with increasingly
exotic domes and ever-richer mosaics, spread west to
[Ravenna](Ravenna "wikilink") and [Venice](Venice "wikilink") in Italy
and as far north as [Moscow](Moscow "wikilink") in Russia.[^576] This
influence can be seen particularly in the [Venetian Gothic
architecture](Venetian_Gothic_architecture "wikilink").

The [architecture of the Seljuk Turks](Seljuk_architecture "wikilink")
combined the elements and characteristics of the [Turkic architecture of
Central Asia](Architecture_of_Central_Asia "wikilink") with those of
[Persian](Persian_architecture "wikilink"),
[Arab](Arab_architecture "wikilink"),
[Armenian](Armenian_architecture "wikilink") and Byzantine architecture.
The transition from Seljuk architecture to Ottoman architecture is most
visible in [Bursa](Bursa "wikilink"), which was the capital of the
Ottoman State between 1335 and 1413. Following the Ottoman conquest of
Constantinople in 1453, Ottoman architecture was significantly
influenced by Byzantine architecture. [Topkap
Palace](Topkap_Palace "wikilink") in Istanbul is one of the most famous
examples of [classical Ottoman
architecture](classical_Ottoman_architecture "wikilink") and was the
primary residence of the [Ottoman Sultans](Ottoman_Sultan "wikilink")
for approximately 400 years.[^577] [Mimar Sinan](Mimar_Sinan "wikilink")
(`{{Circa|1489}}`{=mediawiki}--1588) was the most important architect of
the classical period in Ottoman architecture. He was the chief architect
of at least 374 buildings that were constructed in various
[provinces](eyalet "wikilink") in the 16th century.[^578] [Sedefkar
Mehmed Aa](Sedefkar_Mehmed_Agha "wikilink"), the architect of the [Blue
Mosque](Blue_Mosque,_Istanbul "wikilink") in Istanbul, was an apprentice
of Sinan, later becoming his first assistant in charge of the office of
chief architect.

Since the 18th century, Turkish architecture has been increasingly
influenced by European styles, and this can be particularly seen in the
Tanzimat era buildings of Istanbul like the
[Dolmabahe](Dolmabahe_Palace "wikilink"),
[raan](raan_Palace "wikilink"), [Taksim Military
Barracks](Taksim_Military_Barracks "wikilink") (demolished),
[Feriye](Feriye_Saraylar "wikilink"),
[Beylerbeyi](Beylerbeyi_Palace "wikilink"),
[Kksu](Kksu_Palace "wikilink"),
[Ihlamur](Ihlamur_Palace "wikilink") and
[Yldz](Yldz_Palace "wikilink") palaces, which were all designed by
members of the [Balyan family](Balyan_family "wikilink") of Ottoman
Armenian court architects.[^579] The Ottoman era [waterfront houses
(*yal*)](yal "wikilink") on the Bosphorus also reflect the fusion
between classical Ottoman and European architectural styles. The [First
National Architectural
Movement](First_National_Architectural_Movement "wikilink") in the early
20th century sought to create a new architecture which was based on
motifs from Seljuk and Ottoman architecture.

### Cuisine

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Turkish cuisine}}
```
```{=mediawiki}
{{see also|Ottoman cuisine}}
```
![[Turkish coffee](Turkish_coffee "wikilink") with [Turkish
delight](Turkish_delight "wikilink"). Turkish coffee is a [UNESCO-listed
intangible cultural
heritage](UNESCO_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_Lists "wikilink") of
[Turks](Turkish_people "wikilink").[^580][^581]](Turkish_coffee_in_Istanbul.jpg "Turkish coffee with Turkish delight. Turkish coffee is a UNESCO-listed intangible cultural heritage of Turks.")

[Turkish cuisine](Turkish_cuisine "wikilink") is largely the heritage of
[Ottoman cuisine](Ottoman_cuisine "wikilink"), [^584][^585] which
contains elements of Turkish, [Byzantine](Byzantine_cuisine "wikilink"),
[Balkan](Balkan_cuisine "wikilink"),
[Armenian](Armenian_cuisine "wikilink"),
[Georgian](Georgian_cuisine "wikilink"),
[Kurdish](Kurdish_cuisine "wikilink"), [Arab](Arab_cuisine "wikilink")
and [Persian](Persian_cuisine "wikilink") cuisines.[^586][^587][^588] It
can be described as a fusion and refinement of
[Mediterranean](Mediterranean_cuisine "wikilink"), [Middle
Eastern](Middle_Eastern_cuisine "wikilink"), [Central
Asian](Central_Asian_cuisine "wikilink"), Balkan and [Eastern
European](Eastern_European_cuisine "wikilink") cuisines.[^589][^590] The
country\'s position between Europe, Asia and the Mediterranean Sea
helped the Turks in gaining complete control of the major [trade
routes](trade_route "wikilink"), and an ideal landscape and climate
allowed plants and animals to flourish. Turkish cuisine was well
established by the mid-15th century, which marked the beginning of the
[classical age of the Ottoman
Empire](Classical_Age_of_the_Ottoman_Empire "wikilink").

[Yogurt](Yogurt "wikilink") salads; [mezes](meze "wikilink"); fish and
seafood; grilled, sauteed or steamed meat varieties; vegetables or
[stuffed and wrapped vegetables](dolma "wikilink") cooked with [olive
oil](olive_oil "wikilink"); and drinks like
[sherbet](Sharbat_(beverage) "wikilink"), [ayran](ayran "wikilink") and
[rak](rak "wikilink") became Turkish staples. The empire used its land
and water routes to import exotic ingredients from all over the world.
By the end of the 16th century, the Ottoman court housed over 1,400
live-in cooks and passed laws regulating the freshness of food. Since
the establishment of the republic in 1923, foreign food such as French
[hollandaise sauce](hollandaise_sauce "wikilink") and Western fast food
have made their way into the modern Turkish diet.[^591]

[Fenerbahe](Fenerbahe_Women's_Volleyball "wikilink") and
[Eczacba](Eczacba_Dynavit "wikilink"), have won numerous European
championship titles and medals.[^600]

The traditional national sport of Turkey has been [yal
gre](Oil_wrestling "wikilink") (*[oil](olive_oil "wikilink")

Province has hosted the annual [Krkpnar](Krkpnar "wikilink") oil
wrestling tournament since 1361, making it the oldest continuously held
sporting competition in the world.[^602][^603] In the 19th and early
20th centuries, oil wrestling champions such as [Koca
Yusuf](Yusuf_smail "wikilink"), [Nurullah
Hasan](Nurullah_Hasan "wikilink") and [Kzlckl
Mahmut](Kzlckl_Mahmut "wikilink") acquired international fame in
Europe and North America by winning world heavyweight wrestling
championship titles. International wrestling styles governed by
[FILA](International_Federation_of_Associated_Wrestling_Styles "wikilink")
such as [freestyle wrestling](freestyle_wrestling "wikilink") and
[Greco-Roman wrestling](Greco-Roman_wrestling "wikilink") are also
popular, with many European, World and Olympic championship titles won
by Turkish wrestlers both individually and as a national team.[^604]

### Media and cinema {#media_and_cinema}

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Media in Turkey}}
```
```{=mediawiki}
{{See Also|Cinema of Turkey}}
```
Hundreds of television channels, thousands of local and national radio
stations, several dozen newspapers, a productive and profitable
[national cinema](cinema_of_Turkey "wikilink") and a rapid growth of
[broadband](broadband "wikilink") Internet use constitute a vibrant
media industry in Turkey.[^605][^606] The majority of the TV audiences
are shared among public broadcaster
[TRT](Turkish_Radio_and_Television_Corporation "wikilink") and the
network-style channels such as [Kanal D](Kanal_D "wikilink"), [Show
TV](Show_TV "wikilink"), [ATV](ATV_(Turkey) "wikilink") and [Star
TV](Star_TV_(Turkey) "wikilink"). The [broadcast
media](broadcast_media "wikilink") have a very high penetration as
[satellite dishes](satellite_dishes "wikilink") and
[cable](cable_television "wikilink") systems are widely available.[^607]
The [Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTK)](RTK "wikilink") is
the government body overseeing the broadcast media.[^608][^609] By
circulation, the [most popular
newspapers](List_of_newspapers_in_Turkey "wikilink") are
*[Posta](Posta_(newspaper) "wikilink")*,
*[Hrriyet](Hrriyet "wikilink")*, *[Szc](Szc "wikilink")*,
*[Sabah](Sabah_(newspaper) "wikilink")* and
*[Habertrk](Habertrk "wikilink")*.[^610]

[TRT 2](TRT_2 "wikilink") is the public service channel dedicated to
culture and art, and [TRT Belgesel](TRT_Belgesel "wikilink") is
dedicated to documentaries. In the 21st century some reforms have taken
place to improve the cultural rights of ethnic minorities in Turkey,
such as the establishment of [TRT Kurd](TRT_Kurd "wikilink"), [TRT
Arabi](TRT_Arabi "wikilink") and [TRT Avaz](TRT_Avaz "wikilink") by the
[TRT](Turkish_Radio_and_Television_Corporation "wikilink").

[Turkish television dramas](Turkish_television_drama "wikilink") are
increasingly becoming popular beyond Turkey\'s borders and are among the
country\'s most vital exports, both in terms of profit and public
relations.[^611] After sweeping the [Middle
East](Middle_East "wikilink")\'s television market over the past decade,
Turkish shows have aired in more than a dozen
[South](South_America "wikilink") and [Central
American](Central_America "wikilink") countries in
2016.[^612]`{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2023}}`{=mediawiki}

*[L\'Arrive d\'un train en gare de La
Ciotat](L'Arrive_d'un_train_en_gare_de_La_Ciotat "wikilink")*, which
was shown in Istanbul in 1896. The first Turkish-made film was a
documentary entitled *[Ayastefanos\'taki Rus Abidesinin
Ykl](Ayastefanos'taki_Rus_Abidesinin_Ykl "wikilink")*
(*Demolition of the Russian Monument at [San
Stefano](Yeilky "wikilink")*), directed by [Fuat
Uzknay](Fuat_Uzknay "wikilink") and completed in 1914. The first
narrative film, [Sedat Simavi](Sedat_Simavi "wikilink")\'s *The Spy*,
was released in 1917. Turkey\'s first sound film was shown in 1931.
Turkish directors like [Metin Erksan](Metin_Erksan "wikilink"), [Nuri
Bilge Ceylan](Nuri_Bilge_Ceylan "wikilink"), [Ylmaz
Gney](Ylmaz_Gney "wikilink"), [Zeki

such as the `{{Lang|fr|[[Palme d'Or]]|italic=no}}`{=mediawiki} and
[Golden Bear](Golden_Bear "wikilink").[^618][^619]

Despite legal provisions, [media freedom in
Turkey](media_freedom_in_Turkey "wikilink") has steadily deteriorated
from 2010 onwards, with a precipitous decline following the failed [coup
attempt](2016_Turkish_coup_d'tat_attempt "wikilink") on 15 July
2016.[^620] As of December 2016, at least 81 [journalists were
imprisoned](List_of_arrested_journalists_in_Turkey "wikilink") in Turkey
and more than 100 news outlets were closed.[^621] [Freedom
House](Freedom_House "wikilink") lists Turkey\'s
[media](media_freedom_in_Turkey "wikilink") as [*not
free*](Freedom_of_the_Press_(report) "wikilink").[^622] The media
crackdowns also extend to [Internet
censorship](Internet_censorship "wikilink") with [Wikipedia getting
blocked](2017_block_of_Wikipedia_in_Turkey "wikilink") between 29 April
2017 and 15 January 2020.[^623][^624]

country](archipelagic_country "wikilink") in [Southeast
Asia](Southeast_Asia "wikilink"). In the western [Pacific
Ocean](Pacific_Ocean "wikilink"), it consists of [7,641
islands](List_of_islands_of_the_Philippines "wikilink"), with a total
area of 300,000 square kilometers,[^18] which are broadly categorized in
[three main geographical
divisions](Island_groups_of_the_Philippines "wikilink") from north to
south: [Luzon](Luzon "wikilink"), [Visayas](Visayas "wikilink"), and
[Mindanao](Mindanao "wikilink"). The Philippines is bounded by the
[South China Sea](South_China_Sea "wikilink") to the west, the
[Philippine Sea](Philippine_Sea "wikilink") to the east, and the
[Celebes Sea](Celebes_Sea "wikilink") to the south. It shares [maritime
borders](maritime_border "wikilink") with [Taiwan](Taiwan "wikilink") to
the north, [Japan](Japan "wikilink") to the northeast,
[Palau](Palau "wikilink") to the east and southeast,
[Indonesia](Indonesia "wikilink") to the south,
[Malaysia](Malaysia "wikilink") to the southwest,
[Vietnam](Vietnam "wikilink") to the west, and [China](China "wikilink")
to the northwest. It is the world\'s [twelfth-most-populous
country](List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population "wikilink"),
with diverse [ethnicities](Ethnic_groups_in_the_Philippines "wikilink")
and [cultures](Culture_of_the_Philippines "wikilink").
[Manila](Manila "wikilink") is the country\'s capital, and its [most
populated city](Cities_of_the_Philippines#Largest_cities "wikilink") is
[Quezon City](Quezon_City "wikilink"). Both are within [Metro
Manila](Metro_Manila "wikilink").

[Negritos](Negrito "wikilink"), the archipelago\'s earliest inhabitants,
were followed by
[waves](Models_of_migration_to_the_Philippines "wikilink") of
[Austronesian peoples](Austronesian_peoples "wikilink"). The adoption of
[Animism](Animism "wikilink"), [Hinduism](Hinduism "wikilink") with
[Buddhist](Buddhist "wikilink") influence, and [Islam](Islam "wikilink")
established
[island-kingdoms](History_of_the_Philippines_(9001565) "wikilink")
ruled by [datus](datu "wikilink"), [rajas](raja "wikilink"), and
[sultans](List_of_Muslim_states_and_dynasties "wikilink"). Overseas
trade with neighbors such as the late
[Tang](Tang_dynasty "wikilink")[^19] or
[Song](Song_dynasty "wikilink")[^20] empire brought
[Sinitic](Sinitic "wikilink")-speaking merchants to the archipelago,
which would gradually settle in and
[intermix](Interethnic_marriage "wikilink"). The arrival of [Ferdinand
Magellan](Ferdinand_Magellan "wikilink"), a
[Portuguese](Portuguese_Empire "wikilink") explorer leading a fleet for
Spain, marked the beginning of Spanish colonization. In 1543, Spanish
explorer `{{Lang|es|[[Ruy Lpez de Villalobos]]|italic=no}}`{=mediawiki}
named the archipelago `{{lang|es|Las Islas Filipinas}}`{=mediawiki} in
honor of [King Philip II](Philip_II_of_Spain "wikilink") of
[Castile](Crown_of_Castile "wikilink"). Spanish colonization via [New
Spain](New_Spain "wikilink"), beginning in 1565, led to the Philippines
becoming ruled by the [Crown of Castile](Crown_of_Castile "wikilink"),
as part of the [Spanish Empire](Spanish_Empire "wikilink"), for more
than 300 years. [Catholic](Catholic_Church "wikilink")
[Christianity](Christianity "wikilink") became the dominant religion,
and Manila became the western hub of [trans-Pacific
trade](Spanish_treasure_fleet "wikilink").
[Hispanic](Spaniard "wikilink") immigrants from [Latin
America](Latin_American_Asian "wikilink") and
[Iberia](Iberia "wikilink") would also selectively colonize. The
[Philippine Revolution](Philippine_Revolution "wikilink") began in 1896,
and became entwined with the 1898 [Spanish--American
War](SpanishAmerican_War "wikilink"). Spain ceded the territory to the
United States, and [Filipino
revolutionaries](Hong_Kong_Junta "wikilink") declared the [First
Philippine Republic](First_Philippine_Republic "wikilink"). The ensuing
[Philippine--American War](PhilippineAmerican_War "wikilink") ended
with the United States controlling the territory until the [Japanese
invasion](Philippines_campaign_(19411942) "wikilink") of the islands
during [World War II](World_War_II "wikilink"). After [the United States
retook the Philippines from the
Japanese](Philippines_campaign_(19441945) "wikilink"), the Philippines
became independent in 1946. The country has had a tumultuous experience
with democracy, which included the overthrow of [a decades-long
dictatorship](Martial_law_under_Ferdinand_Marcos "wikilink") in [a
nonviolent revolution](People_Power_Revolution "wikilink").

The Philippines is an [emerging market](emerging_market "wikilink") and
a [newly industrialized
country](newly_industrialized_country "wikilink"), whose economy is
transitioning from being agricultural to service- and
manufacturing-centered. It is a founding member of the [United
Nations](United_Nations "wikilink"), the [World Trade
Organization](World_Trade_Organization "wikilink"),
[ASEAN](ASEAN "wikilink"), the [Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation](Asia-Pacific_Economic_Cooperation "wikilink") forum, and
the [East Asia Summit](East_Asia_Summit "wikilink"); it is a member of
the [Non-Aligned Movement](Non-Aligned_Movement "wikilink") and a [major
non-NATO ally](major_non-NATO_ally "wikilink") of the United States. Its
location as an island country on the Pacific [Ring of
Fire](Ring_of_Fire "wikilink") and close to the equator makes it prone
to [earthquakes](Earthquakes_in_the_Philippines "wikilink") and
[typhoons](Typhoons_in_the_Philippines "wikilink"). The Philippines has
a variety of natural resources and a globally-significant [level of
biodiversity](Megadiverse_countries "wikilink").

## Etymology

```{=mediawiki}
{{main|Names of the Philippines}}
```
During his 1542 expedition, Spanish explorer [Ruy Lpez de
Villalobos](Ruy_Lpez_de_Villalobos "wikilink") named the islands of
[Leyte](Leyte "wikilink") and [Samar](Samar "wikilink")
\"`{{lang|es|Felipinas}}`{=mediawiki}\" after [King Philip II of
Castile](Philip_II_of_Spain "wikilink") (then [Prince of
Asturias](Prince_of_Asturias "wikilink")). Eventually, the name
\"`{{lang|es|Las Islas Filipinas}}`{=mediawiki}\" would be used for the
archipelago\'s Spanish
possessions.[^21]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=15KZU-yMuisC&pg=PA6|name=6}}}}`{=mediawiki}
Other names, such as \"`{{lang|es|Islas del Poniente}}`{=mediawiki}\"
(Western Islands), \"`{{lang|pt|Islas del Oriente}}`{=mediawiki}\"
(Eastern Islands), Ferdinand Magellan\'s name, and
\"`{{lang|es|San Lzaro}}`{=mediawiki}\" (Islands of St. Lazarus), were
used by the Spanish to refer to islands in the region before Spanish
rule was established.[^22][^23][^24]

During the [Philippine Revolution](Philippine_Revolution "wikilink"),
the [Malolos Congress](Malolos_Congress "wikilink") proclaimed the
`{{lang|es|Repblica Filipina}}`{=mediawiki} (the [Philippine
Republic](First_Philippine_Republic "wikilink")).[^25] American colonial
authorities referred to the country as the Philippine Islands (a
translation of the Spanish name).[^26] The [United
States](United_States "wikilink") began changing its nomenclature from
\"the Philippine Islands\" to \"the Philippines\" in the Philippine
Autonomy Act and the [Jones
Law](Jones_Law_(Philippines) "wikilink").[^27] The official title
\"Republic of the Philippines\" was included in the 1935 constitution as
the name of the future independent state,[^28] and in all succeeding
constitutional revisions.[^29][^30]

### Prehistory (pre--900) {#prehistory_pre900}

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Prehistory of the Philippines}}
```
There is [evidence](Archaeology_of_the_Philippines "wikilink") of early
[hominins](hominins "wikilink") living in what is now the Philippines as
early as 709,000 years ago.[^31] A small number of bones from [Callao
Cave](Callao_Cave "wikilink") potentially represent an otherwise unknown

50,000 to 67,000 years ago.[^32][^33] The oldest [modern
human](modern_human "wikilink") remains on the islands are from the
[Tabon Caves](Tabon_Caves "wikilink") of [Palawan](Palawan "wikilink"),
[U/Th-dated](U/Th-dated "wikilink") to 47,000  11--10,000 years

inhabitants descended from the first human migrations out of Africa via
the coastal route along [southern Asia](South_Asia "wikilink") to the
now-sunken landmasses of [Sundaland](Sundaland "wikilink") and
[Sahul](Sahul "wikilink").[^35]

The first Austronesians reached the Philippines from Taiwan around 2200
BC, settling the [Batanes](Batanes "wikilink") Islands (where they built
stone fortresses known as *[ijangs](ijang "wikilink")*)[^36] and
northern [Luzon](Luzon "wikilink"). [Jade
artifacts](Philippine_jade_culture "wikilink") have been dated to
2000 BC,[^37][^38] with [lingling-o](lingling-o "wikilink") jade items
made in Luzon with raw materials from Taiwan.[^39] By 1000 BC, the
inhabitants of the archipelago had developed into four societies:
[hunter-gatherer](hunter-gatherer "wikilink") tribes, warrior societies,
highland [plutocracies](plutocracies "wikilink"), and port
principalities.[^40]

The earliest known surviving written record in the Philippines is the
early-10th-century AD [Laguna Copperplate
Inscription](Laguna_Copperplate_Inscription "wikilink"), which was
written in [Old Malay](Old_Malay "wikilink") using the early
[Kawi](Kawi_alphabet "wikilink") script with a number of technical
[Sanskrit](Sanskrit "wikilink") words and [Old
Javanese](Old_Javanese "wikilink") or [Old
Tagalog](Old_Tagalog "wikilink")
[honorifics](Filipino_styles_and_honorifics "wikilink").[^41] By the
14th century, several large coastal settlements emerged as trading
centers and became the focus of [societal
changes](Cultural_achievements_of_pre-colonial_Philippines "wikilink").[^42]
Some [polities](polities "wikilink") had exchanges with other states
throughout Asia.[^43]`{{rp|page=3}}`{=mediawiki}[^44] Trade with China
is believed to have begun during the [Tang
dynasty](Tang_dynasty "wikilink"), and expanded during the [Song
dynasty](Song_dynasty "wikilink");[^45] by the second millennium AD,
some polities were part of the [tributary system of
China](tributary_system_of_China "wikilink").[^46]`{{rp|pages=177178}}`{=mediawiki}[^47]`{{rp|page=3}}`{=mediawiki}
Indian cultural traits such as linguistic terms and religious practices
[began to
spread](Indian_influences_in_early_Philippine_polities "wikilink") in
the Philippines during the 14th century, probably via the Hindu
[Majapahit Empire](Majapahit "wikilink").[^48][^49] By the 15th century,
Islam was established in the [Sulu
Archipelago](Sulu_Archipelago "wikilink") and spread from there.[^50]

Polities founded in the Philippines between the 10th and 16th centuries
include [Maynila](Maynila_(historical_polity) "wikilink"),[^51]
[Tondo](Tondo_(historical_polity) "wikilink"),
[Namayan](Namayan "wikilink"), [Pangasinan](Caboloan "wikilink"),
[Cebu](Cebu_(historical_state) "wikilink"),
[Butuan](Butuan_(historical_polity) "wikilink"),
[Maguindanao](Sultanate_of_Maguindanao "wikilink"),
[Lanao](Confederate_States_of_Lanao "wikilink"),
[Sulu](Sultanate_of_Sulu "wikilink"), and [Ma-i](Ma-i "wikilink").[^52]
The early polities typically had a three-tier social structure:
nobility, freemen, and dependent
debtor-bondsmen.[^53]`{{rp|page=3}}`{=mediawiki}[^54]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Pn0Pfh1Cl0C&pg=PA672|name=672}}}}`{=mediawiki}
Among the nobility were leaders known as [datus](datu "wikilink"), who
were responsible for ruling autonomous groups
([barangays](Barangay_state "wikilink") or dulohan).[^55] When the
barangays banded together to form a larger settlement or a
geographically looser alliance,[^56]`{{rp|page=3}}`{=mediawiki}[^57]
their more-esteemed members would be recognized as a \"[paramount
datu](Paramount_rulers_in_early_Philippine_history "wikilink")\",[^58]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A40BEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA58|name=58}}}}`{=mediawiki}[^59]
[rajah](rajah "wikilink") or [sultan](sultan "wikilink"),[^60] and would
rule the community.[^61] Population density is thought to have been low

due to the [frequency of typhoons](Typhoon#Frequency "wikilink") and the
Philippines\' location on the Pacific [Ring of
Fire](Ring_of_Fire "wikilink").[^63] Portuguese explorer [Ferdinand
Magellan](Ferdinand_Magellan "wikilink") arrived in 1521, claimed the
islands for Spain, and was killed by [Lapulapu](Lapulapu "wikilink")\'s
men in the [Battle of
Mactan](Battle_of_Mactan "wikilink").[^64]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Z-n_kDTxf0C&pg=PT46|name=21}}}}`{=mediawiki}[^65]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wmgX9M_yETIC&pg=PA261|name=261}}}}`{=mediawiki}

Many [Filipinos](Filipinos "wikilink") were brought to New Spain [as

capital of the [Spanish East Indies](Spanish_East_Indies "wikilink") in
1571,[^70][^71] Spanish territories in Asia and the Pacific.[^72] The
Spanish invaded local states using the principle of [divide and

bringing most of what is the present-day Philippines under one unified
administration.[^74][^75] Disparate barangays were deliberately
[consolidated into towns](Reductions "wikilink"), where [Catholic
missionaries](Friars_in_Spanish_Philippines "wikilink") could more
easily convert their inhabitants to
[Christianity](Christianity "wikilink"),[^76]`{{rp|pages={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xiOQdEzgP9kC&pg=PA53|name=53}}, {{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xiOQdEzgP9kC&pg=PA68|name=68}}}}`{=mediawiki}[^77]
which was initially [Syncretist](Religious_Syncretism "wikilink").[^78]
From 1565 to 1821, the Philippines was governed as a territory of the
[Mexico City](Mexico_City "wikilink")-based [Viceroyalty of New
Spain](New_Spain "wikilink"); it was then administered from
[Madrid](Madrid "wikilink") after the [Mexican War of
Independence](Mexican_War_of_Independence "wikilink").[^79]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gUt5v8ET4QYC&pg=PA81|name=81}}}}`{=mediawiki}
Manila became the western hub of [trans-Pacific

galleons](Manila_galleon "wikilink") built in
[Bicol](Bicol_Region "wikilink") and
[Cavite](Cavite "wikilink").[^81][^82]

Administration of the Philippines was considered a drain on the economy
of New
Spain,[^88]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QKgraWbb7yoC&pg=PA1077|name=1077}}}}`{=mediawiki}
and abandoning it or trading it for other territory was debated. This
course of action was opposed because of the islands\' economic
potential, security, and the desire to continue religious conversion in
the
region.[^89]`{{rp|pages={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A40BEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA7|name=78}}}}`{=mediawiki}[^90]
The colony survived on an annual subsidy from the Spanish

usually paid as 75 tons of silver bullion from the Americas.[^93]
[British forces occupied
Manila](British_occupation_of_Manila "wikilink") from 1762 to 1764
during the [Seven Years\' War](Seven_Years'_War "wikilink"), and Spanish
rule was restored with the [1763 Treaty of
Paris](Treaty_of_Paris_(1763) "wikilink").[^94]`{{rp|pages=8183}}`{=mediawiki}
The Spanish considered their war with the Muslims in Southeast Asia an
extension of the *[Reconquista](Reconquista "wikilink")*.[^95][^96] The
[Spanish--Moro conflict](SpanishMoro_conflict "wikilink") lasted for
several hundred years; Spain conquered portions of
[Mindanao](Mindanao "wikilink") and [Jolo](Jolo "wikilink") during the
last quarter of the 19th century,[^97] and the Muslim
[Moro](Moro_people "wikilink") in the [Sultanate of
Sulu](Sultanate_of_Sulu "wikilink") acknowledged Spanish
sovereignty.[^98][^99] [thumb\|upright=1.1\|alt=Photo of a large group

Philippine ports opened to world trade during the 19th century, and
Filipino society began to change.[^100][^101] Social identity changed,
with the term *Filipino* encompassing all residents of the archipelago
instead of solely referring to [Spaniards born in the
Philippines](Spanish_Filipino "wikilink").[^102][^103]

Revolutionary sentiment grew in 1872 after [three activist Catholic
priests](Gomburza "wikilink") were executed on questionable
grounds.[^104][^105] This inspired the [Propaganda
Movement](Propaganda_Movement "wikilink"), organized by [Marcelo H. del
Pilar](Marcelo_H._del_Pilar "wikilink"), [Jos
Rizal](Jos_Rizal "wikilink"), [Graciano Lpez
Jaena](Graciano_Lpez_Jaena "wikilink"), and [Mariano
Ponce](Mariano_Ponce "wikilink"), which advocated political reform in
the Philippines.[^106] Rizal was executed on December 30, 1896, for
rebellion, and his death radicalized many who had been loyal to
Spain.[^107] Attempts at reform met with resistance; [Andrs
Bonifacio](Andrs_Bonifacio "wikilink") founded the
[Katipunan](Katipunan "wikilink") secret society, which sought
independence from Spain through armed revolt, in
1892.[^108]`{{rp|pages={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gUt5v8ET4QYC&pg=PA137|name=137}}}}`{=mediawiki}

The Katipunan [Cry of Pugad Lawin](Cry_of_Pugad_Lawin "wikilink") began
the [Philippine Revolution](Philippine_Revolution "wikilink") in
1896.[^109] Internal disputes led to the [Tejeros
Convention](Tejeros_Convention "wikilink"), at which Bonifacio lost his
position and [Emilio Aguinaldo](Emilio_Aguinaldo "wikilink") was elected
the new leader of the
revolution.[^110]`{{rp|pages={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wk8yqCEmJUC&pg=PA147|name=145147}}}}`{=mediawiki}
The 1897 [Pact of Biak-na-Bato](Pact_of_Biak-na-Bato "wikilink")
resulted in the [Hong Kong Junta](Hong_Kong_Junta "wikilink") government
in exile. The [Spanish--American War](SpanishAmerican_War "wikilink")
began the following year, and reached the Philippines; Aguinaldo
returned, resumed the revolution, and [declared
independence](Philippine_Declaration_of_Independence "wikilink") from
Spain on June 12,
1898.[^111]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Hd3EAAAQBAJ&pg=PA26|name=26}}}}`{=mediawiki}
In December 1898, the islands were [ceded by
Spain](Treaty_of_Paris_(1898) "wikilink") to the United States with
[Puerto Rico](Puerto_Rico "wikilink") and [Guam](Guam "wikilink") after
the Spanish--American War.[^112][^113]

The [First Philippine Republic](First_Philippine_Republic "wikilink")
was promulgated on January 21, 1899.[^114] Lack of recognition by the
United States led to an [outbreak of
hostilities](Battle_of_Manila_(1899) "wikilink") that, after refusal by
the U.S. on-scene military commander of a cease-fire proposal and a
declaration of war by the nascent
Republic,`{{efn|This is a summary, omitting significant detail. For more detail, see {{section link|Schurman Commission|Survey visit to the Philippines}}.}}`{=mediawiki}

War](PhilippineAmerican_War "wikilink").[^115][^116][^117][^118]

The war resulted in the deaths of 250,000 to 1 million civilians,
primarily due to famine and disease.[^119] Many Filipinos were
transported by the Americans to [concentration
camps](List_of_concentration_and_internment_camps#Philippines "wikilink"),
where thousands died.[^120][^121] After the fall of the First Philippine
Republic in 1902, an [American civilian

established with the [Philippine Organic
Act](Philippine_Organic_Act_(1902) "wikilink").[^122] American forces

on the tarmac](Assassination_of_Ninoy_Aquino "wikilink") at [Manila
International
Airport](Ninoy_Aquino_International_Airport "wikilink").[^182] Marcos
called a snap [presidential election in
1986](1986_Philippine_presidential_election "wikilink")[^183] which
proclaimed him the winner, but the results were widely regarded as
fraudulent.[^184] The resulting protests led to the [People Power
Revolution](People_Power_Revolution "wikilink"),[^185][^186] which
forced Marcos and his allies to flee to [Hawaii](Hawaii "wikilink").
Aquino\'s widow, [Corazon](Corazon_Aquino "wikilink"), was installed as
president.[^187]

![The June [1991 eruption of Mount

June 1991.[^195] Aquino was succeeded by [Fidel V.
Ramos](Fidel_V._Ramos "wikilink"), who
[liberalized](Economic_liberalization "wikilink") the national economy
with [privatization](privatization "wikilink") and
[deregulation](deregulation "wikilink").[^196][^197] Ramos\' economic
gains were overshadowed by the onset of the [1997 Asian financial
crisis](1997_Asian_financial_crisis "wikilink").[^198][^199] His
successor, [Joseph Estrada](Joseph_Estrada "wikilink"), prioritized
public housing[^200] but faced corruption allegations[^201] which led to
his overthrow by the [2001 EDSA

Arroyo\'s [nine-year

[Bangsamoro Organic Law](Bangsamoro_Organic_Law "wikilink") establishing
an autonomous [Bangsamoro](Bangsamoro "wikilink") region, but a
[shootout with MILF rebels in Mamasapano](Mamasapano_clash "wikilink")

[Rodrigo Duterte](Rodrigo_Duterte "wikilink"), elected president [in

[Cebu](Cebu_(island) "wikilink"), [Bohol](Bohol "wikilink") and
[Masbate](Masbate_(island) "wikilink"), about 95 percent of its total

River](Pasig_River "wikilink").[^243]

On the western fringes of the Pacific [Ring of
Fire](Ring_of_Fire "wikilink"), the Philippines has frequent seismic and
volcanic
activity.[^244]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y1CVR74_KHQC&pg=PA4|name=4}}}}`{=mediawiki}
The region is [seismically](Seismology "wikilink") active, and has been
[constructed by
plates](Subduction_tectonics_of_the_Philippines "wikilink") converging
towards each other from multiple directions.[^245][^246] About five
earthquakes are recorded daily, although most are too weak to be
felt.[^247] The [last major

The country has valuable[^251] mineral deposits as a result of its
complex geologic structure and high level of seismic
activity.[^252][^253] It is thought to have the world\'s second-largest
gold deposits (after South Africa), large copper deposits,[^254] and the
world\'s largest deposits of [palladium](palladium "wikilink").[^255]
Other minerals include [chromium](chromium "wikilink"),
[nickel](nickel "wikilink"), [molybdenum](molybdenum "wikilink"),
[platinum](platinum "wikilink"), and [zinc](zinc "wikilink").[^256]
However, poor management and law enforcement, opposition from indigenous
communities, and past environmental damage have left these resources
largely untapped.[^257][^258]

species](Flora_of_the_Philippines "wikilink") in the country (3,500 of
which are endemic),[^265] Philippine rain forests have an array of
flora:[^266][^267] about 3,500 species of trees,[^268] 8,000 [flowering

species.[^272]

As an important part of the [Coral Triangle](Coral_Triangle "wikilink")
ecoregion,[^273][^274] Philippine waters have unique, diverse marine
life[^275] and the world\'s greatest diversity of shore-fish
species.[^276] The country has over 3,200 fish species (121
endemic).[^277] Philippine waters sustain the cultivation of fish,
crustaceans, oysters, and seaweeds.[^278][^279]

Eight major types of forests are distributed throughout the Philippines:
[dipterocarp](Dipterocarpaceae "wikilink"), [beach](beach "wikilink")
forest,[^280] [pine](pine "wikilink") forest,
[molave](Vitex_parviflora "wikilink") forest, [lower montane
forest](Montane_ecosystems "wikilink"), upper montane (or [mossy

[ultrabasic](Ultramafic_rock "wikilink") forest.[^281] According to
official estimates, the Philippines had
`{{convert|7000000|ha|sqmi}}`{=mediawiki} of forest cover in 2023.[^282]
Logging had been systemized during the American colonial period[^283]
and [deforestation](Deforestation_in_the_Philippines "wikilink")
continued after independence, accelerating during the [Marcos
presidency](Martial_law_under_Ferdinand_Marcos "wikilink") due to
unregulated logging concessions.[^284][^285] Forest cover declined from
70 percent of the Philippines\' total land area in 1900 to about 18.3
percent in 1999.[^286] Rehabilitation efforts have had marginal
success.[^287]

The Philippines is a [priority hotspot for biodiversity

The Philippines has a tropical maritime climate which is usually hot and
humid. There are three seasons: a hot [dry
season](dry_season "wikilink") from March to May, a [rainy
season](Wet_season "wikilink") from June to November, and a cool dry
season from December to February.[^295] The southwest
[monsoon](monsoon "wikilink") (known as the
`{{lang|fil|habagat}}`{=mediawiki}) lasts from May to October, and the
northeast monsoon (`{{lang|fil|[[amihan]]}}`{=mediawiki}) lasts from
November to
April.[^296]`{{rp|pages={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sY7EBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA24|name=2425}}}}`{=mediawiki}
The coolest month is January, and the warmest is May. Temperatures at
sea level across the Philippines tend to be in the same range,
regardless of latitude; average annual temperature is around
`{{convert|26.6|C|F}}`{=mediawiki} but is
`{{convert|18.3|C|F}}`{=mediawiki} in [Baguio](Baguio "wikilink"),
`{{convert|1500|m|sp=us}}`{=mediawiki} above sea level.[^297] The
country\'s average [humidity](humidity "wikilink") is 82
percent.[^298]`{{rp|pages={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sY7EBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA24|name=2425}}}}`{=mediawiki}
Annual rainfall is as high as `{{convert|5000|mm|sp=us}}`{=mediawiki} on
the mountainous east coast, but less than
`{{convert|1000|mm|sp=us}}`{=mediawiki} in some sheltered valleys.[^299]

The [Philippine Area of
Responsibility](Philippine_Area_of_Responsibility "wikilink") has 19
[typhoons](Typhoons_in_the_Philippines "wikilink") in a typical
year,[^300] usually from July to October;[^301] eight or nine of them
make [landfall](landfall "wikilink").[^302][^303] The wettest recorded
typhoon to hit the Philippines dropped
`{{convert|2210|mm|sp=us}}`{=mediawiki} in Baguio from July 14 to 18,
1911.[^304] The country [is

and the 2016 [Enhanced Defense Cooperation
Agreement](Enhanced_Defense_Cooperation_Agreement "wikilink").[^356] The
country supported American policies during the [Cold
War](Cold_War "wikilink") and participated in the
[Korean](Korean_War "wikilink") and [Vietnam](Vietnam_War "wikilink")
wars.[^357][^358] In 2003, the Philippines was designated a major
non-NATO ally.[^359] [Under President
Duterte](Presidency_of_Rodrigo_Duterte "wikilink"), ties with the United
States weakened in favor of improved relations with China and
[Russia](PhilippinesRussia_relations "wikilink").[^360][^361][^362] The
Philippines relies heavily on the United States for its external
defense;[^363]`{{rp|page=11}}`{=mediawiki} the U.S. has made regular
assurances to defend the Philippines,[^364] including the [South China
Sea](South_China_Sea "wikilink").[^365]

Since 1975, the Philippines has valued its [relations with
China](ChinaPhilippines_relations "wikilink")[^366]---its top trading
partner,[^367] and cooperates significantly with the
country.[^368][^369] Japan is the biggest bilateral contributor of
[official development
assistance](official_development_assistance "wikilink") to the
Philippines;[^370][^371] although some tension exists because of [World
War II](World_War_II "wikilink"), much animosity has
faded.[^372]`{{rp|loc={{plain link|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927161330/http://countrystudies.us/philippines/93.htm|name=93}}}}`{=mediawiki}
Historical and cultural ties continue to affect [relations with
Spain](PhilippinesSpain_relations "wikilink").[^373][^374] Relations
with Middle Eastern countries are shaped by the high number of Filipinos
working in those countries,[^375] and by issues related to the Muslim
minority in the Philippines;[^376] concerns have been raised about
domestic abuse and war affecting[^377] the approximately 2.5 million
overseas Filipino workers in the region.[^378]

The Philippines [has claims](Spratly_Islands_dispute "wikilink") in the
[Spratly Islands](Spratly_Islands "wikilink") which overlap with claims
by China, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam.[^379] The largest of [its
controlled islands](Philippines_and_the_Spratly_Islands "wikilink") is
[Thitu Island](Thitu_Island "wikilink"), which contains the
[Philippines\' smallest town](Kalayaan,_Palawan "wikilink").[^380] The
2012 [Scarborough Shoal
standoff](Scarborough_Shoal_standoff "wikilink"), after China seized the
shoal from the Philippines, led to an [international arbitration
case](Philippines_v._China "wikilink")[^381] which the Philippines
eventually won;[^382] China rejected the result,[^383] and made the
shoal a prominent symbol of the broader dispute.[^384]

### Military

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Armed Forces of the Philippines}}
```
![[BRP Jose Rizal (FF-150)](BRP_Jose_Rizal_(FF-150) "wikilink") is the
[lead ship](lead_ship "wikilink") of [her
class](Jose_Rizal-class_frigate "wikilink") of [Philippine
Navy](Philippine_Navy "wikilink") [guided missile
frigates](guided_missile_frigate "wikilink").](BRP_Jose_Rizal_at_RIMPAC_2020_005.jpg "BRP Jose Rizal (FF-150) is the lead ship of her class of Philippine Navy guided missile frigates.")

The [volunteer](Volunteer_military "wikilink") Armed Forces of the
Philippines (AFP) consist of three branches: the [Philippine Air
Force](Philippine_Air_Force "wikilink"), the [Philippine
Army](Philippine_Army "wikilink"), and the [Philippine
Navy](Philippine_Navy "wikilink").[^385][^386] Civilian security is
handled by the [Philippine National
Police](Philippine_National_Police "wikilink") under the [Department of
the Interior and Local
Government](Department_of_the_Interior_and_Local_Government "wikilink").[^387]
The AFP had a total manpower of around 280,000
`{{as of|2022|lc=y}}`{=mediawiki}, of which 130,000 were active military
personnel, 100,000 were reserves, and 50,000 were
[paramilitaries](Citizen_Armed_Force_Geographical_Unit "wikilink").[^388]

In 2021, \$4,090,500,000 (1.04 percent of GDP) was spent on the
Philippine military.[^389][^390] Most of the country\'s defense spending
is on the Philippine Army, which leads operations against internal
threats such as
[communist](Communist_armed_conflicts_in_the_Philippines "wikilink") and
[Muslim](Moro_conflict "wikilink") separatist insurgencies; its
preoccupation with internal security contributed to the decline of
[Philippine naval
capability](List_of_equipment_of_the_Philippine_Navy "wikilink") which
began during the 1970s.[^391] [A military modernization
program](AFP_Modernization_Act "wikilink") began in 1995[^392] and
expanded in 2012 to build a more capable defense system.[^393]

The Philippines has long struggled against [local
insurgencies](Civil_conflict_in_the_Philippines "wikilink"),
[separatism](Separatism_in_the_Philippines "wikilink"), and
[terrorism](Terrorism_in_the_Philippines "wikilink").[^394][^395][^396]
[Bangsamoro](Bangsamoro "wikilink")\'s largest separatist organizations,
the [Moro National Liberation
Front](Moro_National_Liberation_Front "wikilink") and the [Moro Islamic
Liberation Front](Moro_Islamic_Liberation_Front "wikilink"), signed
final peace agreements with the government in
[1996](1996_Final_Peace_Agreement "wikilink") and
[2014](Comprehensive_Agreement_on_the_Bangsamoro "wikilink")
respectively.[^397][^398] Other, more-militant groups such as [Abu
Sayyaf](Abu_Sayyaf "wikilink") and [Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom
Fighters](Bangsamoro_Islamic_Freedom_Fighters "wikilink")[^399] have
kidnapped foreigners for ransom, particularly in the Sulu
Archipelago[^400][^401] and [Maguindanao](Maguindanao "wikilink"),[^402]
but their presence has been reduced.[^403][^404] The [Communist Party of
the Philippines](Communist_Party_of_the_Philippines "wikilink") and its
military wing, the [New People\'s Army](New_People's_Army "wikilink"),
have been waging [guerrilla
warfare](Communist_rebellion_in_the_Philippines "wikilink") against the
government since the 1970s and, although shrinking militarily and
politically after the return of democracy in 1986,[^405][^406] have
[engaged](Timeline_of_the_communist_rebellion_in_the_Philippines "wikilink")
in ambushes, bombings, and assassinations of government officials and
security forces.[^407]

### Administrative divisions {#administrative_divisions}

{{Main|Administrative divisions of the Philippines}}
```
[thumb\|upright=1.2\|alt=Color-coded political map of the
Philippines\|The Philippines\' regions and
provinces](File:Ph_regions_and_provinces.svg "wikilink")

The Philippines is divided into 17
[regions](Regions_of_the_Philippines "wikilink"), 82
[provinces](Provinces_of_the_Philippines "wikilink"), 146
[cities](Cities_of_the_Philippines "wikilink"), 1,488
[municipalities](Municipalities_of_the_Philippines "wikilink"), and
42,036 [barangays](barangay "wikilink").[^408] Regions other than
[Bangsamoro](Bangsamoro "wikilink") are divided for administrative
convenience.[^409] [Calabarzon](Calabarzon "wikilink") was the region
with the greatest population `{{as of|2020|lc=y}}`{=mediawiki}, and the
[National Capital Region](Metro_Manila "wikilink") (NCR) was the most
densely populated.[^410]

The Philippines is a [unitary state](unitary_state "wikilink"), with the
exception of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao
(BARMM),[^411] although there have been [steps towards
decentralization](Federalism_in_the_Philippines "wikilink");[^412][^413]
a 1991 law [devolved](devolution "wikilink") some powers to [local
governments](Local_government_in_the_Philippines "wikilink").[^414]

## Demographics

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Demographics of the Philippines}}
```
```{=mediawiki}
{{see also|List of cities in the Philippines}}
```
As of May 1, 2020, the Philippines had a population of
109,035,343.[^415] In 2020, 54 percent of the country\'s population
lived in [urban areas](urban_area "wikilink").[^416]
[Manila](Manila "wikilink"), its capital, and [Quezon
City](Quezon_City "wikilink") (the country\'s most populous city) are in
[Metro Manila](Metro_Manila "wikilink"). About 13.48 million people
({{#expr: (13484462/109033245)\*100 round 0}} percent of the
Philippines\' population) live in Metro Manila,[^417] the [country\'s
most populous metropolitan
area](List_of_metropolitan_areas_in_the_Philippines "wikilink")[^418]
and the world\'s [fifth most
populous](List_of_largest_cities "wikilink").[^419] Between 1948 and
2010, the population of the Philippines increased almost fivefold from
19 million to 92 million.[^420]

The [country\'s median age](List_of_countries_by_median_age "wikilink")
is 25.3, and 63.9 percent of its population is between 15 and 64 years
old.[^421] The Philippines\' average annual population growth rate is
decreasing,[^422] although government attempts to further reduce
population growth have been
[contentious](Reproductive_Health_Bill_(Philippines) "wikilink").[^423]
The country reduced its [poverty
rate](Poverty_in_the_Philippines "wikilink") from 49.2 percent in
1985[^424] to 18.1 percent in 2021,[^425] and its [income
inequality](Income_inequality_in_the_Philippines "wikilink") began to
decline in 2012.[^426]

```
```{=mediawiki}
{{See also|Filipinos|Pinoy}}
```
![Dominant ethnic groups by
province](Peoples_of_the_Philippines_en.svg "Dominant ethnic groups by province")

The country has substantial ethnic diversity, due to foreign influence
and the archipelago\'s division by water and topography.[^427] According
to the 2010 census, the Philippines\' largest ethnic groups were
[Tagalog](Tagalog_people "wikilink") (24.4 percent),
[Visayans](Visayans "wikilink") \[excluding the
[Cebuano](Cebuano_people "wikilink"),
[Hiligaynon](Hiligaynon_people "wikilink") and
[Waray](Waray_people "wikilink")\] (11.4 percent), Cebuano (9.9
percent), [Ilocano](Ilocano_people "wikilink") (8.8 percent), Hiligaynon
(8.4 percent), [Bikol](Bicolano_people "wikilink") (6.8 percent), and
Waray (four percent).[^428][^429] The [country\'s indigenous
peoples](Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Philippines "wikilink") consisted of
110 enthnolinguistic groups, with a combined population of 14 to
17 million, in 2010;[^430] they include the
[Igorot](Igorot_people "wikilink"), [Lumad](Lumad "wikilink"),
[Mangyan](Mangyan "wikilink"), and the [indigenous peoples of
Palawan](Peoples_of_Palawan "wikilink").[^431]

[Negritos](Negrito "wikilink") are thought to be among the islands\'
earliest
inhabitants.[^432]`{{rp|loc={{plain link|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927160916/http://countrystudies.us/philippines/35.htm|name=35}}}}`{=mediawiki}
These minority aboriginal settlers are an
[Australoid](Australo-Melanesian "wikilink") group, a remnant of the
[first human migration from Africa to
Australia](Southern_Dispersal "wikilink") who were probably displaced by
later waves of migration.[^433] Some Philippine Negritos have a
[Denisovan](Denisovan "wikilink") admixture in their
[genome](genome "wikilink").[^434][^435] Ethnic Filipinos generally
belong to several Southeast Asian ethnic groups, classified
linguistically as [Austronesians](Austronesian_peoples "wikilink")
speaking [Malayo-Polynesian
languages](Malayo-Polynesian_languages "wikilink").[^436] The
Austronesian population\'s origin is uncertain, but relatives of
[Taiwanese aborigines](Taiwanese_indigenous_peoples "wikilink") probably
brought their language and mixed with the region\'s existing
population.[^437][^438] The Lumad and
[Sama-Bajau](Sama-Bajau "wikilink") ethnic groups have an ancestral
affinity with the [Austroasiatic-](Austroasiatic_languages "wikilink")
and [Mlabri-speaking](Mlabri_language "wikilink")
[Htin](Lua_people "wikilink") peoples of mainland Southeast Asia.
Westward expansion from [Papua New Guinea](Papua_New_Guinea "wikilink")
to eastern Indonesia and Mindanao has been detected in the [Blaan
people](Blaan_people "wikilink") and the [Sangir
language](Sangir_language "wikilink").[^439]

Immigrants arrived in the Philippines from elsewhere in the Spanish
Empire, especially [from the Spanish
Americas](Latin_American_Asian "wikilink").[^440][^441]`{{rp|loc={{plain link|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614082235/https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/forced-migration-in-the-spanish-pacific-world/unruly-mexicans-in-manila/EF2599210A0715A5A91B23BB9D84B96C|name=Chpt. 6}}}}`{=mediawiki}[^442]

Descendants of mixed-race couples are known as
[Mestizos](Filipino_Mestizos "wikilink") or
`{{lang|fil|tisoy}}`{=mediawiki},[^445] which during the [Spanish
colonial times](History_of_the_Philippines_(15651898) "wikilink"), were
mostly composed of [Chinese mestizos](Sangley "wikilink")
(`{{lang|es|Mestizos de Sangley}}`{=mediawiki}), [Spanish
mestizos](Spanish_Filipino "wikilink")
(`{{lang|es|Mestizos de Espaol}}`{=mediawiki}) and the mix thereof
(`{{lang|es|[[Torna atrs|tornatrs]]}}`{=mediawiki}).[^446][^447][^448]
The modern [Chinese Filipinos](Chinese_Filipino "wikilink") are
well-integrated into Filipino society.[^449][^450] Primarily the
descendants of immigrants from [Fujian](Fujian "wikilink"),[^451] the
pure ethnic Chinese Filipinos during the [American colonial
era](History_of_the_Philippines_(18981946) "wikilink") (early 1900s)
purportedly numbered about 1.35 million; while an estimated 22.8 million
(around 20 percent) of Filipinos have half or partial Chinese ancestry
from precolonial, colonial, and 20th century Chinese
migrants.[^452][^453] During the Hispanic era, [mixed Spanish
Filipinos](Spanish_Filipino "wikilink") made up a moderate proportion
(around 5 percent) of the population who were paying
tributes.[^454]`{{rp|539}}`{=mediawiki}[^455]`{{rp|31,54,113}}`{=mediawiki}
Meanwhile, [a smaller proportion (2.33 percent) of the population were
Latin American
Filipinos](Mexican_settlement_in_the_Philippines "wikilink").[^456]`{{rp|100}}`{=mediawiki}
Almost 300,000 [American citizens](Americans "wikilink") live in the
country `{{As of|2023|lc=y}}`{=mediawiki},[^457] and up to 250,000
[Amerasians](Amerasian "wikilink") are scattered across the cities of
[Angeles](Angeles_City "wikilink"), Manila, and
[Olongapo](Olongapo "wikilink").[^458][^459] Other significant
non-indigenous minorities include
[Indians](Indian_Filipino "wikilink")[^460] and
[Arabs](Arabs_in_the_Philippines "wikilink").[^461] [Japanese
Filipinos](Japanese_in_the_Philippines "wikilink") include escaped
Christians ([Kirishitan](Kirishitan "wikilink")) who [fled persecutions
by Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu](Martyrs_of_Japan "wikilink").[^462]

### Languages

![Ethnolinguistic
map\|upright=1.2](Ethnolinguistic_map_of_the_Philippines.png "Ethnolinguistic map|upright=1.2")

*[Ethnologue](Ethnologue "wikilink")* lists 186 languages for the
Philippines, 182 of which are [living
languages](living_language "wikilink"); the other four no longer have
any known speakers. Most native languages are part of the [Philippine
branch](Philippine_languages "wikilink") of the [Malayo-Polynesian
languages](Malayo-Polynesian_languages "wikilink"), which is a branch of
the [Austronesian language
family](Austronesian_languages "wikilink").[^463] Spanish-based
[creole](Creole_language "wikilink") varieties, collectively known as
[Chavacano](Chavacano "wikilink"), are also spoken.[^464] Many
[Philippine Negrito
languages](Philippine_Negrito_languages#Unique_vocabulary "wikilink")
have unique vocabularies which survived Austronesian
acculturation.[^465]

[Filipino](Filipino_language "wikilink") and
[English](Philippine_English "wikilink") are the country\'s official
languages.[^466] Filipino, a [standardized
version](Standard_language "wikilink") of
[Tagalog](Tagalog_language "wikilink"), is spoken primarily in Metro
Manila.[^467] Filipino and English are used in government, education,
print, broadcast media, and business, often with a third local
language;[^468] [code-switching](code-switching "wikilink") between
English and other local languages, notably
[Tagalog](Taglish "wikilink"), is common.[^469] The Philippine
constitution provides for [Spanish](Philippine_Spanish "wikilink") and
Arabic on a voluntary, optional basis.[^470] Spanish, a widely used
[lingua franca](lingua_franca "wikilink") during the late nineteenth
century, [has declined greatly in
use](Spanish_language_in_the_Philippines "wikilink"),[^471][^472]
although Spanish [loanwords](loanword "wikilink") are still present in
Philippine languages.[^473][^474][^475] Arabic is primarily taught in
[Mindanao](Mindanao "wikilink") Islamic schools.[^476]

The top languages generally spoken at home
`{{as of|2020|lc=y}}`{=mediawiki} are Tagalog,

[Cebu](Cebu "wikilink").](Sto._Nino_Basilica_de_Cebu_from_the_Pligrim's_Center.jpg "Catholics attend Mass at Basilica del Santo Nio during the annual Sinulog festival in Cebu.")

Although the Philippines is a [secular
state](Secularism_in_the_Philippines "wikilink") with [freedom of
religion](Freedom_of_religion_in_the_Philippines "wikilink"), an
overwhelming majority of Filipinos [consider religion very
important](Importance_of_religion_by_country "wikilink")[^481] and
[irreligion](Irreligion_in_the_Philippines "wikilink") is very
low.[^482][^483][^484]
[Christianity](Christianity_in_the_Philippines "wikilink") is the
dominant religion,[^485][^486] followed by about 89 percent of the
population.[^487] The country had the [world\'s third-largest Roman
Catholic population](Catholic_Church_by_country "wikilink")
`{{as of|2013|lc=y}}`{=mediawiki}, and was Asia\'s [largest Christian
nation](Christianity_in_Asia "wikilink").[^488] Census data from
[2020](2020_Philippine_census "wikilink") found that 78.8 percent of the
population professed [Roman
Catholicism](Catholic_Church_in_the_Philippines "wikilink"); other
Christian denominations include
`{{lang|tl|[[Iglesia ni Cristo]]|italic=no}}`{=mediawiki}, the
[Philippine Independent
Church](Philippine_Independent_Church "wikilink"), and [Seventh-day
Adventistism](Seventh-day_Adventist_Church "wikilink").[^489]
[Protestants](Protestantism_in_the_Philippines "wikilink") made up about
5% to 7% of the population in 2010.[^490][^491] The Philippines sends
many [Christian missionaries](Christian_mission "wikilink") around the
world, and is a training center for foreign priests and
nuns.[^492][^493]

[Islam](Islam_in_the_Philippines "wikilink") is the country\'s
second-largest religion, with 6.4 percent of the population in the 2020
census.[^494] Most Muslims live in Mindanao and nearby islands,[^495]
and most adhere to the [Shafi\'i school](Shafi'i_school "wikilink") of
[Sunni Islam](Sunni_Islam "wikilink").[^496]

About 0.2 percent of the population follow [indigenous
religions](indigenous_Philippine_folk_religions "wikilink"),[^497] whose
practices and folk beliefs are often
[syncretized](Religious_syncretism "wikilink") with Christianity and
Islam.[^498]`{{rp|pages={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y1CVR74_KHQC&pg=PA29|name=2930}}}}`{=mediawiki}[^499]

the national and local governments, although private payments account
for most healthcare
spending.[^502]`{{rp|pages=2527}}`{=mediawiki}[^503] Per-capita health
expenditure in 2022 was

The 2019 enactment of the [Universal Health Care
Act](universal_health_care "wikilink") by President Duterte facilitated
the automatic enrollment of all Filipinos in the [national health
insurance

Since 2018, [Malasakit Centers](Malasakit_Center "wikilink") (one-stop
shops) have been set up in several government-operated hospitals to
provide medical and financial assistance to indigent patients.[^508]

Average life expectancy in the Philippines
`{{as of|2023|lc=y}}`{=mediawiki} is 70.48 years (66.97 years for males,
and 74.15 years for females).[^509] Access to medicine has improved due

university.[^516]](Main_Bulding_of_the_University_of_Santo_Tomas.jpg "Founded in 1611, the University of Santo Tomas is Asia's oldest extant university.")

Primary and secondary schooling in the Philippines consists of six years
of elementary period, four years of junior high school, and two years of
senior high school.[^518] Public education, provided by the government,
is free at the elementary and secondary levels and at [most public
higher-education
institutions](Universal_Access_to_Quality_Tertiary_Education_Act "wikilink").[^519][^520]
[Science high schools](Philippine_Science_High_School_System "wikilink")
for talented students were established in 1963.[^521] The government
provides technical-vocational training and development through the
[Technical Education and Skills Development
Authority](Technical_Education_and_Skills_Development_Authority "wikilink").[^522]
In 2004, the government began offering [alternative
education](Alternative_Learning_System_(Philippines) "wikilink") to
out-of-school children, youth, and adults to improve
literacy;[^523][^524] [madaris](madrasa "wikilink") were mainstreamed in
16 regions that year, primarily in Mindanao Muslim areas under the
[Department of
Education](Department_of_Education_(Philippines) "wikilink").[^525]

The Philippines has [1,975 higher education
institutions](List_of_colleges_and_universities_in_the_Philippines "wikilink")
`{{as of|2019|lc=y}}`{=mediawiki}, of which 246 are public and 1,729 are
private.[^526] Public universities are non-sectarian, and are primarily
classified as
[state-administered](List_of_state_schools,_colleges_and_universities_in_the_Philippines "wikilink")
or [local
government-funded](Local_colleges_and_universities_(Philippines) "wikilink").[^527][^528]

## Economy

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Economy of the Philippines}}
```
The Philippine economy is the world\'s [34th
largest](List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal) "wikilink"), with an
estimated `{{as of|2023|bare=yes}}`{=mediawiki} nominal [gross domestic
product](gross_domestic_product "wikilink") of
`{{currency|435.7&nbsp;billion|USD|linked=no|passthrough=yes}}`{=mediawiki}.[^537]
As a [newly industrialized
country](newly_industrialized_country "wikilink"),[^538][^539] the
Philippine economy has been transitioning from an agricultural base to
one with more emphasis on services and manufacturing.[^540][^541] The
country\'s labor force was around 50 million
`{{as of|2023|lc=y}}`{=mediawiki}, and its [unemployment
rate](List_of_sovereign_states_by_unemployment_rate "wikilink") was 3.1
percent.[^542] Gross international reserves totaled
`{{currency|103.406&nbsp;billion|USD|linked=no|passthrough=yes}}`{=mediawiki}
`{{as of|2024|January|lc=y}}`{=mediawiki}.[^543] [Debt-to-GDP
ratio](Debt-to-GDP_ratio "wikilink") decreased to 60.2 percent at the
end of 2023 from a 17-year high 63.7 percent at the end of the third
quarter of that year, and indicated resiliency during the [COVID-19
pandemic](COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_Philippines "wikilink").[^544] The
country\'s unit of [currency](currency "wikilink") is the [Philippine
peso](Philippine_peso "wikilink") ([^545] or PHP[^546]).[^547]

The Philippines is a net
importer,[^548]`{{rp|pages=5556,6165,77,83,111}}`{=mediawiki}[^549]
and a [debtor
nation](Net_international_investment_position "wikilink").[^550]
`{{as of|2020}}`{=mediawiki}, the country\'s main export markets were
China, the United States, Japan, Hong Kong, and Singapore;[^551] primary
exports included [integrated circuits](integrated_circuit "wikilink"),
office machinery and parts, electrical transformers, insulated wiring,
and [semiconductors](semiconductor "wikilink").[^552] Its primary import
markets that year were China, Japan, South Korea, the United States, and
Indonesia.[^553] Major export crops include
[coconuts](Coconut_production_in_the_Philippines "wikilink"),
[bananas](Banana_industry#Production_and_export "wikilink"), and
[pineapples](List_of_countries_by_pineapple_production "wikilink"); it
is the world\'s largest producer of
[abaca](abaca "wikilink"),[^554]`{{rp|pages={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90C4DgAAQBAJ&pg=PA226|name=226242}}}}`{=mediawiki}

With an average annual growth rate of six to seven percent since around
2010, the Philippines has emerged as one of the world\'s fastest-growing
economies,[^559] driven primarily by its increasing reliance on the
service sector.[^560] Regional development is uneven, however, with
Manila (in particular) gaining most of the new economic
growth.[^561][^562] [Remittances](Remittance "wikilink") from [overseas
Filipinos](overseas_Filipinos "wikilink") contribute significantly to
the country\'s economy;[^563][^564] they reached a record
`{{currency|37.20&nbsp;billion|USD|linked=no|passthrough=yes}}`{=mediawiki}
in 2023, accounting for 8.5 percent of GDP.[^565] The Philippines is the
world\'s primary [business process
outsourcing](Business_process_outsourcing_in_the_Philippines "wikilink")
(BPO) center.[^566][^567] About 1.3 million Filipinos work in the BPO
sector, primarily in [customer
service](customer_service "wikilink").[^568]

The Philippines has one of the largest agricultural-research systems in
Asia, despite relatively low spending on agricultural research and
development.[^569][^570] The country has developed new varieties of
crops, including
[rice](Rice_production_in_the_Philippines "wikilink"),[^571][^572]
coconuts,[^573] and bananas.[^574] Research organizations include the
[Philippine Rice Research
Institute](Philippine_Rice_Research_Institute "wikilink")[^575] and the
[International Rice Research

The [Philippine Space Agency](Philippine_Space_Agency "wikilink")
maintains the [country\'s space
program](Philippine_space_program "wikilink"),[^577][^578] and the
country bought its first
[satellite](List_of_Philippine_satellites "wikilink") in 1996.[^579]
[Diwata-1](Diwata-1 "wikilink"), its first
[micro-satellite](Small_satellite#Microsatellites "wikilink"), was
launched on the United States\' [Cygnus](Cygnus_(spacecraft) "wikilink")
spacecraft in 2016.[^580]

The Philippines has a [high
concentration](List_of_countries_by_smartphone_penetration "wikilink")
of [cellular-phone](Mobile_phone "wikilink") users,[^581] and a high
level of [mobile commerce](mobile_commerce "wikilink").[^582] [Text
messaging](Text_messaging "wikilink") is a popular form of
communication, and the nation sent an average of one billion
[SMS](SMS "wikilink") messages per day in 2007.[^583] The [Philippine
telecommunications
industry](Telecommunications_in_the_Philippines "wikilink") had been
dominated by the [PLDT](PLDT "wikilink")-[Globe
Telecom](Globe_Telecom "wikilink") duopoly for more than two
decades,[^584] and the 2021 entry of [Dito
Telecommunity](Dito_Telecommunity "wikilink") improved the country\'s
telecommunications service.[^585]

[Bohol](Bohol "wikilink")](Chocolate_Hills_and_tourists.jpg "Tourists at Chocolate Hills, conical karst hills in Bohol")
The Philippines is a popular retirement destination for foreigners
because of its climate and low cost of living;[^586] the country is also
a top destination for diving enthusiasts.[^587][^588] [Tourist
spots](List_of_tourist_attractions_in_the_Philippines "wikilink")
include [Boracay](Boracay "wikilink"), called the best island in the

Tourism contributed 5.2 percent to the Philippine GDP in 2021 (lower
than 12.7 percent in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic),[^591] and
provided 5.7 million jobs in 2019.[^592] The Philippines attracted
5.45 million international visitors in 2023, 30 percent lower than the
8.26 million record in pre-pandemic 2019; most tourists came from South
Korea (26.4 percent), United States (16.5 percent), Japan (5.6 percent),
Australia (4.89 percent), and China (4.84 percent).[^593]

## Infrastructure

### Transportation

![Traditional *(left)* and modern [jeepneys](jeepney "wikilink") in
[Quezon City](Quezon_City "wikilink"). Public utility vehicles older
than 15 years are [gradually being phased
out](Public_Utility_Vehicle_Modernization_Program "wikilink") in favor
of eco-friendly [Euro

vehicles.[^594]](Traditional_and_modern_jeepneys_in_Diliman,_Quezon_City_on_March_16,_2023.jpg "Traditional (left) and modern jeepneys in Quezon City. Public utility vehicles older than 15 years are gradually being phased out in favor of eco-friendly Euro 4-compliant vehicles.")

[Transportation in the
Philippines](Transportation_in_the_Philippines "wikilink") is by road,
air, rail and water. Roads are the dominant form of transport, carrying
98 percent of people and 58 percent of cargo.[^596] In December 2018,
there were `{{convert|210528|km|mi|sp=us}}`{=mediawiki} of roads in the
country.[^597] The backbone of land-based transportation in the country
is the [Pan-Philippine Highway](Pan-Philippine_Highway "wikilink"),
which connects the islands of Luzon, Samar, Leyte, and Mindanao.[^598]
Inter-island transport is by the
`{{convert|919|km|mi|adj=on|sp=us}}`{=mediawiki} [Strong Republic
Nautical Highway](Strong_Republic_Nautical_Highway "wikilink"), an
integrated set of highways and [ferry](ferry "wikilink") routes linking
17 cities.[^599][^600] [Jeepneys](Jeepney "wikilink") are a popular,
iconic public utility
vehicle;[^601]`{{rp|pages={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90C4DgAAQBAJ&pg=PA496|name=496497}}}}`{=mediawiki}
other public land transport includes
[buses](List_of_bus_companies_of_the_Philippines "wikilink"), [UV
Express](UV_Express "wikilink"),
`{{abbr|TNVS|transport network vehicle service}}`{=mediawiki}, Filcab,
[taxis](Taxis_of_the_Philippines "wikilink"), and
[tricycles](Motorized_tricycle_(Philippines) "wikilink").[^602][^603]
Traffic is a significant issue [in
Manila](Traffic_in_Metro_Manila "wikilink") and on arterial roads to the
capital.[^604][^605]

Despite wider historical use,[^606] [rail transportation in the
Philippines](rail_transportation_in_the_Philippines "wikilink") is
limited[^607]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90C4DgAAQBAJ&pg=PA491|name=491}}}}`{=mediawiki}
to [transporting passengers within Metro

provinces of [Laguna](Laguna_(province) "wikilink")[^608] and
[Quezon](Quezon "wikilink"),[^609] with a short track in the [Bicol
Region](Bicol_Region "wikilink").[^610]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90C4DgAAQBAJ&pg=PA491|name=491}}}}`{=mediawiki}
The country had a railway footprint of only
`{{convert|79|km|sp=us}}`{=mediawiki} `{{as of|2019|lc=y}}`{=mediawiki},
which it planned to expand to
`{{convert|244|km|sp=us}}`{=mediawiki}.[^611] A revival of [freight
rail](freight_rail "wikilink") is planned to reduce road
congestion.[^612][^613]

The Philippines had [90 national government-owned
airports](List_of_airports_in_the_Philippines "wikilink")
`{{as of|2022|lc=y}}`{=mediawiki}, of which eight are
[international](international_airport "wikilink").[^614] [Ninoy Aquino
International Airport](Ninoy_Aquino_International_Airport "wikilink"),
formerly known as Manila International Airport, has the [greatest number
of
passengers](List_of_the_busiest_airports_in_the_Philippines "wikilink").[^615]
The 2017 [air domestic
market](List_of_airlines_of_the_Philippines "wikilink") was dominated by
[Philippine Airlines](Philippine_Airlines "wikilink"), the country\'s
[flag carrier](flag_carrier "wikilink") and Asia\'s oldest commercial
airline,[^616][^617] and [Cebu Pacific](Cebu_Pacific "wikilink") (the
country\'s leading [low-cost
carrier](low-cost_carrier "wikilink")).[^618][^619]

A variety of boats are used throughout the Philippines;[^620] most are
[double-outrigger](outrigger_boat "wikilink") vessels known as
*banca*[^621] or
`{{lang|fil|[[Bangka (boat)|bangka]]}}`{=mediawiki}.[^622] Modern ships
use plywood instead of logs, and motor engines instead of sails;[^623]
they are used for fishing and inter-island travel.[^624] The Philippines
has [over 1,800
seaports](List_of_ports_in_the_Philippines "wikilink");[^625] of these,
the principal seaports of [Manila](Port_of_Manila "wikilink") (the
country\'s chief, and busiest, port),[^626]
[Batangas](Batangas_International_Port "wikilink"), [Subic
Bay](Port_of_Subic_Bay "wikilink"), [Cebu](Port_of_Cebu "wikilink"),

The Philippines had a total installed power capacity of 26,882
[MW](Watt "wikilink") in 2021; 43 percent was generated from
[coal](Coal_mining_in_the_Philippines "wikilink"), 14 percent from
[oil](oil "wikilink"), 14 percent [hydropower](hydropower "wikilink"),
12 percent from [natural gas](natural_gas "wikilink"), and seven percent
from [geothermal](Geothermal_power "wikilink") sources.[^629] It is the
world\'s third-biggest [geothermal-energy
producer](Geothermal_power_in_the_Philippines "wikilink"), behind the
United States and Indonesia.[^630] The country\'s largest dam is the
`{{convert|1.2|km|mi|adj=mid|-long|sp=us}}`{=mediawiki} [San Roque
Dam](San_Roque_Dam_(Philippines) "wikilink") on the [Agno
River](Agno_River "wikilink") in
[Pangasinan](Pangasinan "wikilink").[^631] The [Malampaya gas
field](Malampaya_gas_field "wikilink"), discovered in the early 1990s
off the coast of Palawan, reduced the Philippines\' reliance on imported
oil; it provides about 40 percent of Luzon\'s energy requirements, and
30 percent of the country\'s energy
needs.[^632]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90C4DgAAQBAJ&pg=PA347|name=347}}}}`{=mediawiki}[^633]

The Philippines has three [electrical
grids](electrical_grid "wikilink"), one each for Luzon, Visayas, and
Mindanao.[^634] The [National Grid Corporation of the
Philippines](National_Grid_Corporation_of_the_Philippines "wikilink")
manages [the country\'s power
grid](Electricity_sector_in_the_Philippines "wikilink") since 2009[^635]
and provides [overhead transmission
lines](overhead_power_line "wikilink") across the country\'s islands.
Electric distribution to consumers [is
provided](List_of_electric_distribution_utilities_in_the_Philippines "wikilink")
by privately owned distribution utilities and government-owned [electric
cooperatives](electric_cooperative "wikilink").[^636] As of end-2021,
the Philippines\' household electrification level was about
95.41%.[^637]

Plans to harness [nuclear
energy](Nuclear_power_in_the_Philippines "wikilink") began during the
early 1970s during the [presidency of Ferdinand
Marcos](presidency_of_Ferdinand_Marcos "wikilink") in response to the
[1973 oil crisis](1973_oil_crisis "wikilink").[^638] The Philippines
completed [Southeast Asia\'s first nuclear power
plant](Bataan_Nuclear_Power_Plant "wikilink") in
[Bataan](Bataan "wikilink") in 1984.[^639] Political issues following
Marcos\' ouster and safety concerns after the 1986 [Chernobyl
disaster](Chernobyl_disaster "wikilink") prevented the plant from being
commissioned,[^640][^641] and plans to operate it remain
controversial.[^642][^643]

### Water supply and sanitation {#water_supply_and_sanitation}

```
![A water-district office in [Banate,
Iloilo](Banate,_Iloilo "wikilink")](Banate_Water_District.jpg "A water-district office in Banate, Iloilo")

Water supply and sanitation outside Metro Manila is provided by the
government through local [water districts](water_district "wikilink") in
cities or towns.[^644][^645][^646] Metro Manila is served by [Manila
Water](Manila_Water "wikilink") and [Maynilad Water
Services](Maynilad_Water_Services "wikilink"). Except for shallow wells
for domestic use, groundwater users are required to obtain a permit from
the [National Water Resources
Board](National_Water_Resources_Board "wikilink").[^647] In 2022, the
total water withdrawals increased to
`{{convert|91|e9m3|sp=us}}`{=mediawiki} from
`{{convert|89|e9m3|sp=us}}`{=mediawiki} in 2021 and the total
expenditures on water were amounted to
{{#expr:59.37+47.12+38.32}} billion.[^648]

Most sewage in the Philippines flows into septic tanks.[^649] In 2015,
the [Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and
Sanitation](Joint_Monitoring_Programme_for_Water_Supply_and_Sanitation "wikilink")
noted that 74 percent of the Philippine population had access to
[improved sanitation](improved_sanitation "wikilink") and \"good
progress\" had been made between 1990 and 2015.[^650] Ninety-six percent
of Filipino households had an improved source of drinking water and 92
percent of households had sanitary toilet facilities
`{{as of|2016|lc=y}}`{=mediawiki}; connections of toilet facilities to
appropriate sewerage systems remain largely insufficient, however,
especially in rural and urban poor
communities.[^651]`{{rp|page=46}}`{=mediawiki}

people](Ifugao_people "wikilink")](Banaue_Philippines_Banaue-Rice-Terraces-01.jpg "The Banaue Rice Terraces, carved by ancestors of the Ifugao people")

The Philippines has significant cultural diversity, reinforced by the
country\'s fragmented
geography.[^652]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r50BEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA61|name=61}}}}`{=mediawiki}[^653]
Spanish and American cultures profoundly influenced Filipino culture as
a result of long colonization.[^654][^655] The cultures of Mindanao and
the Sulu Archipelago developed distinctly, since they had limited
Spanish influence and more influence from nearby Islamic
regions.[^656]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Pn0Pfh1Cl0C&pg=PA503|name=503}}}}`{=mediawiki}
Indigenous groups such as the [Igorots](Igorot "wikilink") have
preserved their precolonial customs and traditions by resisting the
Spanish.[^657][^658] A [national
identity](Filipino_nationalism "wikilink")
[emerged](National_revival "wikilink") during the 19th century, however,
with [shared national
symbols](National_symbols_of_the_Philippines "wikilink") and cultural
and historical [touchstones](Touchstone_(metaphor) "wikilink").[^659]

[Hispanic legacies](Spanish_influence_on_Filipino_culture "wikilink")

Catholicism[^660]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wmgX9M_yETIC&pg=PA5|name=5}}}}`{=mediawiki}[^661]
and the prevalence of [Spanish names and
surnames](Catlogo_alfabtico_de_apellidos "wikilink"), which resulted
from an 1849 edict ordering the systematic distribution of family names
and the implementation of [Spanish naming
customs](Spanish_naming_customs "wikilink");[^662]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90C4DgAAQBAJ&pg=PA75|name=75}}}}`{=mediawiki}[^663]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Z-n_kDTxf0C&pg=PT262|name=237}}}}`{=mediawiki}
the names of many locations also have Spanish origins.[^664] American
influence on modern Filipino culture[^665] is evident in the use of
English[^666]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zN7-s84jAkoC&pg=PA12|name=12}}}}`{=mediawiki}

[Festivals](List_of_festivals_in_the_Philippines "wikilink") are
primarily religious, and most towns and villages have such a festival
(usually to honor a [patron
saint](patron_saint "wikilink")).[^669][^670] Better-known festivals
include [Ati-Atihan](Ati-Atihan_festival "wikilink"),[^671]
[Dinagyang](Dinagyang "wikilink"),[^672]
[Moriones](Moriones_Festival "wikilink"),[^673]
[Sinulog](Sinulog "wikilink"),[^674] and [Flores de
Mayo](Flores_de_Mayo "wikilink")---a month-long devotion to the [Virgin
Mary](Virgin_Mary "wikilink") held in May.[^675] The country\'s
[Christmas season](Christmas_in_the_Philippines "wikilink") begins as
early as September
1,[^676]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JmCpDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA149|name=149}}}}`{=mediawiki}
and [Holy Week](Holy_Week_in_the_Philippines "wikilink") is a solemn
religious observance for its Christian
population.[^677][^678]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JmCpDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA149|name=149}}}}`{=mediawiki}

### Values

{{Further|Filipino values}}
```
![Statue in [Iriga](Iriga "wikilink") commemorating
`{{lang|fil|[[Mano (gesture)|mano po]]}}`{=mediawiki}](Core_Value.JPG "Statue in Iriga commemorating ")

Filipino [values](Value_(ethics_and_social_sciences) "wikilink") are
rooted primarily in personal alliances based in
[kinship](Philippine_kinship "wikilink"), obligation, friendship,
religion (particularly Christianity), and
commerce.[^679]`{{rp|loc={{plain link|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927161138/https://countrystudies.us/philippines/41.htm|name=41}}}}`{=mediawiki}
They center around social harmony through
`{{lang|fil|[[pakikisama]]}}`{=mediawiki},[^680]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=puYpTx1gE40C&pg=PA74|name=74}}}}`{=mediawiki}
motivated primarily by the desire for acceptance by a
group.[^681][^682][^683]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zN7-s84jAkoC&pg=PA47|name=47}}}}`{=mediawiki}
Reciprocity through `{{lang|fil|[[utang na loob]]}}`{=mediawiki} (a debt
of gratitude) is a significant Filipino cultural trait, and an
internalized debt can never be fully
repaid.[^684]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=puYpTx1gE40C&pg=PA76|name=76}}}}`{=mediawiki}[^685]
The main sanction for divergence from these values are the concepts of
`{{lang|fil|hiya}}`{=mediawiki} (shame)[^686] and loss of
`{{lang|es|amor propio}}`{=mediawiki}
([self-esteem](self-esteem "wikilink")).[^687]

The family is central to Philippine society; norms such as loyalty,
maintaining close relationships and care for elderly parents are
ingrained in Philippine society.[^688][^689] Respect for authority and
the elderly is valued, and is shown with gestures such as
`{{lang|fil|mano}}`{=mediawiki} and the
[honorifics](Filipino_styles_and_honorifics "wikilink")
`{{lang|fil|po}}`{=mediawiki} and `{{lang|fil|opo}}`{=mediawiki} and
`{{lang|fil|kuya}}`{=mediawiki} (older brother) or
`{{lang|fil|ate}}`{=mediawiki} (older sister).[^690][^691] Other
Filipino values are optimism about the future, pessimism about the
present, concern about other people, friendship and friendliness,
[hospitality](hospitality "wikilink"), religiosity, respect for oneself
and others (particularly [women](Women_in_the_Philippines "wikilink")),
and integrity.[^692]

### Art and architecture {#art_and_architecture}

```{=mediawiki}

the
Philippines](National_Museum_of_the_Philippines "wikilink")]('Spoliarium'_by_Juan_Luna.jpg "Juan Luna's Spoliarium (1884) at the National Museum of the Philippines")

Philippine art combines indigenous folk art and foreign influences,
primarily Spain and the United States.[^693][^694] During the Spanish
colonial period, art was used to spread Catholicism and support the
concept of racially-superior groups.[^695] Classical paintings were
mainly religious;[^696] prominent artists during Spanish colonial rule
included [Juan Luna](Juan_Luna "wikilink") and [Flix Resurreccin
Hidalgo](Flix_Resurreccin_Hidalgo "wikilink"), whose works drew
attention to the Philippines.[^697] [Modernism](Modernism "wikilink")
was introduced to the Philippines during the 1920s and 1930s by
[Victorio Edades](Victorio_Edades "wikilink") and popular
[pastoral](pastoral "wikilink") scenes by [Fernando
Amorsolo](Fernando_Amorsolo "wikilink").[^698]

![The early-18th-century Earthquake Baroque [Paoay
Church](Paoay_Church "wikilink") in [Ilocos

Philippines[^699]](St._Agustine_Paoay_Church_02.jpg "The early-18th-century Earthquake Baroque Paoay Church in Ilocos Norte, a National Cultural Treasure and a UNESCO World Heritage Site as one of four Baroque Churches of the Philippines")
Traditional Philippine architecture has two main models: the indigenous
`{{lang|fil|[[bahay kubo]]}}`{=mediawiki} and the
`{{lang|fil|[[bahay na bato]]}}`{=mediawiki}, which developed under
Spanish
rule.[^701]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90C4DgAAQBAJ&pg=PA438|name=438444}}}}`{=mediawiki}
Some regions, such as [Batanes](Batanes "wikilink"), differ slightly due
to climate; limestone was used as a building material, and houses were
built to withstand typhoons.[^702][^703]

[Spanish architecture](Spanish_architecture "wikilink") left an imprint
in town designs around a [central square](poblacion "wikilink") or
`{{lang|es|plaza mayor}}`{=mediawiki}, but many of its buildings were
demolished during World War II.[^704] Several Philippine churches
adapted [baroque architecture](baroque_architecture "wikilink") to
withstand earthquakes, leading to the development of [Earthquake
Baroque](Earthquake_Baroque "wikilink");[^705][^706] [four baroque
churches](Baroque_Churches_of_the_Philippines "wikilink") have been
listed as a collective UNESCO [World Heritage
Site](World_Heritage_Site "wikilink").[^707] [Spanish colonial
fortifications](Spanish_colonial_fortifications_in_the_Philippines "wikilink")
(`{{lang|es|fuerzas}}`{=mediawiki}) in several parts of the Philippines
were primarily designed by missionary architects and built by Filipino
stonemasons.[^708] [Vigan](Vigan "wikilink"), in [Ilocos
Sur](Ilocos_Sur "wikilink"), is known for its Hispanic-style houses and
buildings.[^709]

American rule introduced new architectural styles in the construction of
government buildings and [Art Deco](Art_Deco "wikilink") theaters.[^710]
During the American period, some city planning using architectural
designs and master plans by [Daniel Burnham](Daniel_Burnham "wikilink")
was done in portions of [Manila](Burnham_Plan_of_Manila "wikilink") and
[Baguio](Baguio "wikilink").[^711][^712] Part of the Burnham plan was
the construction of government buildings reminiscent of
[Greek](Ancient_Greek_architecture "wikilink") or [Neoclassical
architecture](Neoclassical_architecture "wikilink").[^713][^714]
Buildings from the Spanish and American periods can be seen in
[Iloilo](Iloilo "wikilink"), especially in [Calle
Real](Calle_Real,_Iloilo "wikilink").[^715]

### Music and dance {#music_and_dance}

There are two types of Philippine [folk dance](folk_dance "wikilink"),
stemming from traditional indigenous influences and Spanish
influence.[^718]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y1CVR74_KHQC&pg=PA173|name=173}}}}`{=mediawiki}
Although native dances had become less
popular,[^719]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qLQOd-PFxe4C&pg=PA77|name=77}}}}`{=mediawiki}
folk dancing began to revive during the
1920s.[^720]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qLQOd-PFxe4C&pg=PA82|name=82}}}}`{=mediawiki}
The [Cariosa](Cariosa "wikilink"), a Hispanic Filipino dance, is
unofficially considered the country\'s national dance.[^721] Popular
indigenous dances include the [Tinikling](Tinikling "wikilink") and
[Singkil](Singkil_(Maranao_dance) "wikilink"), which include the
rhythmic clapping of bamboo poles.[^722][^723] Present-day dances vary
from delicate [ballet](ballet "wikilink")[^724] to street-oriented
[breakdancing](breakdancing "wikilink").[^725][^726]

[Rondalya](Rondalla "wikilink") music, with traditional
[mandolin](mandolin "wikilink")-type
[instruments](List_of_Philippine_musical_instruments "wikilink"), was
popular during the Spanish
era.[^727]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DmkPEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA327|name=327}}}}`{=mediawiki}[^728]
Spanish-influenced musicians are primarily
[bandurria](bandurria "wikilink")-based bands with 14-string
guitars.[^729][^730] [Kundiman](Kundiman "wikilink") developed during
the 1920s and 1930s.[^731] The American colonial period exposed many
Filipinos to [U.S. culture](Culture_of_the_United_States "wikilink") and
[popular music](Music_of_the_United_States "wikilink").[^732] [Rock
music](Rock_music "wikilink") was introduced to Filipinos during the
1960s and developed into Filipino rock (or [Pinoy
rock](Pinoy_rock "wikilink")), a term encompassing [pop
rock](pop_rock "wikilink"), [alternative
rock](alternative_rock "wikilink"), [heavy
metal](heavy_metal_music "wikilink"), [punk](punk_rock "wikilink"), [new
wave](new_wave_music "wikilink"), [ska](ska "wikilink"), and
[reggae](reggae "wikilink"). Martial law in the 1970s produced [Filipino
folk rock](Philippine_folk_music "wikilink") bands and artists who [were
at the
forefront](Protest_music_against_the_Marcos_dictatorship "wikilink") of
political
demonstrations.[^733]`{{rp|pages={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ot2uDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA38|name=3841}}}}`{=mediawiki}
The decade also saw the birth of the [Manila
sound](Manila_sound "wikilink") and [Original Pilipino
Music](Original_Pilipino_Music "wikilink")
(OPM).[^734][^735]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Z-n_kDTxf0C&pg=PT196|name=171}}}}`{=mediawiki}
[Filipino hip-hop](Filipino_hip-hop "wikilink"), which originated in
1979, entered the mainstream in
1990.[^736][^737]`{{rp|pages={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ot2uDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA38|name=3841}}}}`{=mediawiki}
[Karaoke](Karaoke "wikilink") is also popular.[^738] From 2010 to 2020,
[Pinoy pop](Pinoy_pop "wikilink") (P-pop) was influenced by
[K-pop](K-pop "wikilink") and [J-pop](J-pop "wikilink").[^739]

Locally produced theatrical drama became established during the late
1870s. Spanish influence around that time introduced
`{{lang|es|[[zarzuela]]}}`{=mediawiki} plays (with music)[^740] and
`{{lang|es|[[Comedia (play)|comedia]]}}`{=mediawiki}s, with dance. The
plays became popular throughout the
country,[^741]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qLQOd-PFxe4C&pg=PA69|name=6970}}}}`{=mediawiki}
and were written in a number of local languages.[^742] American
influence introduced [vaudeville](vaudeville "wikilink") and
ballet.[^743]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qLQOd-PFxe4C&pg=PA69|name=6970}}}}`{=mediawiki}
[Realistic](Realism_(theatre) "wikilink") theatre became dominant during
the 20th century, with plays focusing on contemporary political and
social issues.[^744]

### Literature

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Philippine literature}}
```
[thumb\|upright=0.8\|alt=photograph of Jos Rizal\|Jos Rizal\'s
writings inspired the [Philippine
Revolution](Philippine_Revolution "wikilink").](File:Jose_Rizal_full.jpg "wikilink")

Philippine literature consists of [works](Filipiniana "wikilink")
usually written in Filipino,
[Spanish](Philippine_literature_in_Spanish "wikilink"), or
[English](Philippine_literature_in_English "wikilink"). Some of the
earliest well-known works were created from the 17th to the
19th centuries.[^745] They include
`{{lang|fil|[[Ibong Adarna]]}}`{=mediawiki}, an epic about an eponymous
magical bird,[^746] and `{{lang|fil|[[Florante at Laura]]}}`{=mediawiki}
by Tagalog author [Francisco
Balagtas](Francisco_Balagtas "wikilink").[^747][^748] [Jos
Rizal](Jos_Rizal "wikilink") wrote the novels
`{{lang|es|[[Noli Me Tngere (novel)|Noli Me Tngere]]}}`{=mediawiki}
(*Social Cancer*) and `{{lang|es|[[El filibusterismo]]}}`{=mediawiki}
(*The Reign of Greed*),[^749] both of which depict the injustices of
Spanish colonial rule.[^750]

[Folk literature](Philippine_folk_literature "wikilink") was relatively
unaffected by colonial influence until the 19th century due to Spanish
indifference. Most printed literary works during Spanish colonial rule
were religious in nature, although [Filipino
elites](Ilustrado "wikilink") who later learned Spanish wrote
nationalistic
literature.[^751]`{{rp|pages={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y1CVR74_KHQC&pg=PA59|name=5962}}}}`{=mediawiki}
The American arrival
[began](Education_in_the_Philippines_during_American_rule "wikilink")

English[^752]`{{rp|pages={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y1CVR74_KHQC&pg=PA65|name=6566}}}}`{=mediawiki}
and influenced the development of the [Philippine
comics](Philippine_comics "wikilink") industry that flourished from the
1920s through the 1970s.[^753][^754] In the late 1960s, during the
presidency of Ferdinand Marcos, Philippine literature was [influenced by
political
activism](Student_activism_in_the_Philippines_(19651972) "wikilink");
many poets began using Tagalog, in keeping with the country\'s oral
traditions.[^755]`{{rp|pages={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y1CVR74_KHQC&pg=PA69|name=6971}}}}`{=mediawiki}

[Philippine mythology](Philippine_mythology "wikilink") has been handed
down primarily through oral tradition;[^756] popular
[figures](List_of_Philippine_mythological_figures "wikilink") are [Maria
Makiling](Maria_Makiling "wikilink"),[^757]
[Lam-ang](Biag_ni_Lam-Ang "wikilink"),[^758] and the
[Sarimanok](Sarimanok "wikilink").[^759]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y1CVR74_KHQC&pg=PA61|name=61}}}}`{=mediawiki}[^760]
The country has a number of [folk
epics](Philippine_epic_poetry "wikilink").[^761] Wealthy families could
preserve transcriptions of the epics as family heirlooms, particularly
in Mindanao; the [Maranao-language](Maranao_language "wikilink")
*[Darangen](Darangen "wikilink")* is an example.[^762]

### Media

{{main|Mass media in the Philippines|Cinema of the Philippines}}
```
![People\'s Television Network
logo](People's_Television_Network_Logo_(2017-present).jpg "People's Television Network logo")

Philippine media primarily uses Filipino and English, although
[broadcasting](broadcasting "wikilink") has shifted to Filipino.[^763]
[Television shows](List_of_Philippine_television_shows "wikilink"),
commercials, and [films](Lists_of_Philippine_films "wikilink") are
regulated by the [Movie and Television Review and Classification
Board](Movie_and_Television_Review_and_Classification_Board "wikilink").[^764][^765]
Most Filipinos obtain news and information from television, the
Internet,[^766] and [social
media](Social_media_use_in_the_Philippines "wikilink").[^767] The
country\'s flagship state-owned broadcast-television network is the
[People\'s Television Network](People's_Television_Network "wikilink")
(PTV).[^768] [ABS-CBN](ABS-CBN "wikilink") and
[GMA](GMA_Network "wikilink"), both
[free-to-air](free-to-air "wikilink"), were the dominant TV
networks;[^769] before the May 2020 [expiration of ABS-CBN\'s
franchise](ABS-CBN_franchise_renewal_controversy "wikilink"), it was the
country\'s largest network.[^770] [Philippine television
dramas](Philippine_television_drama "wikilink"), known as
`{{lang|fil|teleserye}}`{=mediawiki}s and mainly produced by
[ABS-CBN](List_of_ABS-CBN_original_drama_series "wikilink") and
[GMA](List_of_GMA_Network_original_drama_series "wikilink"), are also
seen in several other countries.[^771][^772]

Local film-making [began in
1919](List_of_Philippine_films_before_1940 "wikilink") with the release
of the first Filipino-produced [feature film](feature_film "wikilink"):
`{{lang|fil|[[Dalagang Bukid]]}}`{=mediawiki} (*A Girl from the
Country*), directed by [Jose
Nepomuceno](Jos_Nepomuceno "wikilink").[^773][^774]`{{rp|page=8}}`{=mediawiki}
[Production companies](List_of_Philippine_film_studios "wikilink")
remained small during the [silent film](silent_film "wikilink") era, but
sound films and larger productions emerged in 1933. The postwar 1940s to
the early 1960s are considered a high point for Philippine cinema. The
1962--1971 decade saw a decline in quality films, although the
commercial film industry expanded until the 1980s.[^775] Critically
acclaimed Philippine films include `{{lang|fil|[[Himala]]}}`{=mediawiki}
(*Miracle*) and `{{lang|es|[[Oro, Plata, Mata]]}}`{=mediawiki} (*Gold,
Silver, Death*), both released in 1982.[^776][^777] Since the turn of
the 21st century, the country\'s film industry has struggled to compete
with larger-budget foreign films[^778] (particularly [Hollywood
films](Cinema_of_the_United_States "wikilink")).[^779][^780] [Art
films](Art_film "wikilink") have thrived, however, and several [indie
films](Philippine_New_Wave "wikilink") have been successful domestically
and abroad.[^781][^782][^783]

The Philippines has a large number of [radio
stations](List_of_radio_stations_in_the_Philippines "wikilink") and
[newspapers](List_of_newspapers_in_the_Philippines "wikilink").[^784]
English [broadsheets](broadsheet "wikilink") are popular among
executives, professionals and
students.[^785]`{{rp|pages={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W1h9oF9rj-MC&pg=PA233|name=233251}}}}`{=mediawiki}
Less-expensive Tagalog
[tabloids](tabloid_(newspaper_format) "wikilink"), which grew during the
1990s, are popular (particularly in Manila);[^786] however, overall
newspaper readership is declining in favor of [online
news](Social_media_as_a_news_source "wikilink").[^787][^788] The top
three newspapers, by nationwide readership and
credibility,[^789]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1VI9AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA233|name=233}}}}`{=mediawiki}
are the *[Philippine Daily
Inquirer](Philippine_Daily_Inquirer "wikilink")*, *[Manila
Bulletin](Manila_Bulletin "wikilink")*, and *[The Philippine
Star](The_Philippine_Star "wikilink")*.[^790][^791] Although [freedom of
the press](freedom_of_the_press "wikilink") is protected by the
constitution,[^792] the country was listed as the seventh-most-dangerous
country for journalists in 2022 by the [Committee to Protect
Journalists](Committee_to_Protect_Journalists "wikilink") due to 13
unsolved murders of journalists.[^793]

The Philippine population are the world\'s top Internet users.[^794] In
early 2021, 67 percent of Filipinos (73.91 million) had Internet access;
the overwhelming majority used
[smartphones](smartphone "wikilink").[^795] The Philippines ranked 56th
on the [Global Innovation Index](Global_Innovation_Index "wikilink") in
2023,[^796] up from its 2014 ranking of 100th.[^797]

### Cuisine

```{=mediawiki}
{{main|Filipino cuisine}}
```
![A bowl of fish
*[sinigang](sinigang "wikilink")*](Fish_sinigang.jpg "A bowl of fish sinigang")

From its Malayo-Polynesian origins, traditional Philippine cuisine has
evolved since the 16th century. It was primarily influenced by Hispanic,
[Chinese](Filipino_Chinese_cuisine "wikilink"), and
[American](American_cuisine "wikilink") cuisines, which were adapted to
the Filipino palate.[^798][^799] Filipinos tend to prefer robust
flavors,[^800] centered on sweet, salty, and sour
combinations.[^801]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ldCPEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA88|name=88}}}}`{=mediawiki}
Regional variations exist throughout the country; rice is the general
staple [starch](Starch#Food "wikilink")[^802] but
[cassava](Cassava-based_dishes "wikilink") is more common in parts of
Mindanao.[^803][^804] [Adobo](Philippine_adobo "wikilink") is the
unofficial national dish.[^805] Other [popular
dishes](List_of_Philippine_dishes "wikilink") include
*[lechn](lechn "wikilink")*, *[kare-kare](kare-kare "wikilink")*,
*[sinigang](sinigang "wikilink")*,[^806] *[pancit](pancit "wikilink")*,
*[lumpia](lumpia "wikilink")*, and *[arroz
caldo](arroz_caldo "wikilink")*.[^807][^808][^809] [Traditional
desserts](List_of_Philippine_desserts "wikilink") are
`{{lang|fil|kakanin}}`{=mediawiki} ([rice cakes](rice_cake "wikilink")),
which include *[puto](puto_(food) "wikilink")*,
*[suman](suman_(food) "wikilink")*, and
*[bibingka](bibingka "wikilink")*.[^810][^811] Ingredients such as
[calamansi](calamansi "wikilink"),[^812]
*[ube](Ube_halaya "wikilink")*,[^813] and
*[pili](Canarium_ovatum "wikilink")* are used in Filipino
desserts.[^814][^815] The generous use of
[condiments](Philippine_condiments "wikilink") such as
*[patis](patis_(sauce) "wikilink")*, *[bagoong](bagoong "wikilink")*,
and *[toyo](Soy_sauce#Filipino "wikilink")* impart a distinctive
Philippine
flavor.[^816][^817]`{{rp|page={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ldCPEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA73|name=73}}}}`{=mediawiki}

Unlike other East or Southeast Asian countries, most Filipinos do not
eat with [chopsticks](chopsticks "wikilink"); they use spoons and
forks.[^818] Traditional eating with the fingers[^819] (known as
`{{lang|fil|[[kamayan]]}}`{=mediawiki}) had been used in less urbanized
areas,[^820]`{{rp|pages={{plain link|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y6vTun3i4NQC&pg=PA266|name=266268, <!--Estimate--> 277}}}}`{=mediawiki}
but has been popularized with the introduction of Filipino food to
foreigners and city residents.[^821][^822]
